# Objective
# Specification Agent Action Plan for "Terminal Velocity" Project

## Objectives
1. **Ensure consistency** across character interactions, world-building, and thematic exploration.
2. **Validate coherence** in narrative progression and character development.
3. **Align all monitored files** with the overarching goals of the project.

## Action Steps
### Phase 1: Initial File Monitoring Setup
1. **Establish Monitoring Protocols:**
   - Activate monitoring on the primary files listed in the directives.
   - Ensure that change detection for character profiles and interaction scripts is operational.

2. **Log Initial State:**
   - Create a baseline log of the current state of all monitored files, noting any existing inconsistencies or redundancies.

### Phase 2: Content Validation and Analysis
1. **Conduct Consistency Checks:**
   - Review character profiles for contradictions and redundancies.
   - Validate narrative chapters for coherence and alignment with thematic goals.

2. **Assess Emotional Depth:**
   - Analyze interaction scripts for emotional complexity and ethical dilemmas.
   - Document findings and identify areas needing enhancement.

### Phase 3: Implementation of Modifications
1. **Deduplication Process:**
   - Utilize Aider to identify and eliminate redundant traits in character profiles.
   - Ensure that all character development arcs are unique and well-defined.

2. **Enhancement of Interaction Scripts:**
   - Propose edits to interaction scripts that deepen emotional engagement and present ethical challenges.
   - Document all changes made for future reference.

3. **Narrative Chapter Refinement:**
   - Propose improvements to chapter transitions and emotional impact, focusing on key scenes identified during analysis.
   - Utilize Aider to implement these changes and maintain narrative coherence.

### Phase 4: Final Validation and Documentation
1. **Conduct Final Consistency and Coherence Checks:**
   - Reassess character profiles and narrative chapters post-modification to ensure all changes align with project priorities.
   - Ensure that emotional depth and ethical engagement are present in all interaction scripts.

2. **Compile Documentation:**
   - Maintain detailed logs of all modifications, validations, and inconsistencies identified during the process.
   - Document the rationale behind each modification to provide context for future reference.

### Phase 5: Continuous Monitoring and Feedback Loop
1. **Establish Ongoing Monitoring:**
   - Set up a system for continuous monitoring of the specified files to capture any future changes or inconsistencies.
   - Ensure that the Specification Agent remains responsive to new developments in the project.

2. **Feedback Mechanism:**
   - Implement a feedback loop to evaluate the effectiveness of modifications and the overall narrative coherence.
   - Adjust monitoring and modification strategies based on feedback and evolving project needs.

### Step 6: Validation Rules Enforcement
- **Character Interaction Validation**: Regularly validate that all interaction scripts contain elements of emotional depth, conflict resolution, and collaboration.
- **World-Building Validation**: Confirm that cultural, societal, and technological elements are accurately represented and integrated with character development.
- **Thematic Validation**: Ensure that all philosophical concepts are clearly articulated and relevant to the character arcs and narrative progression.

#### Step 1: Initial Monitoring Setup
- **Initiate Monitoring**: Start by setting up monitoring processes for the specified primary files:
  - Character Development Files
  - Narrative Structure and Scenes
  - World-Building and Thematic Elements
  - Economic and Sociological Contexts

#### Step 2: Change Detection
- **Conduct a Change Audit**: Review recent modifications to:
  - Character profiles for inconsistencies.
  - Scene descriptions for coherence with the narrative arc.
  - World-building details for completeness and relevance.

#### Step 3: Addressing Content Gaps
- **Identify Missing Sections**: Search for placeholders or incomplete sections in:
  - Narrative structure files (e.g., missing scene transitions).
  - World-building documents (e.g., cultural or technological elements).

#### Step 4: Redundancy and Duplication Check
- **Run Redundancy Analysis**: Flag any duplicated content in:
  - Character profiles (e.g., overlapping traits or backstories).
  - Thematic elements (e.g., repeated motifs or concepts).

#### Step 5: Implement Modifications
- **Character Consistency Updates**: 
  - Utilize `DuplicationAgent` to streamline any identified inconsistencies in character attributes and interactions.

- **Narrative Coherence Revisions**: 
  - Engage `ValidationAgent` to ensure all scenes align with the main plot and enhance emotional depth.

- **World-Building Enhancements**: 
  - Enrich underdeveloped sections based on identified gaps, ensuring cultural and technological contexts are robust.
  - Apply the `Style Guide` for tone and style consistency.

- **Economic and Sociological Integration**: 
  - Update economic frameworks to reflect narrative developments.
  - Validate sociological research for accuracy and relevance.

#### Step 6: Validation Process
- **Conduct Content Validation**:
  - Review character arcs for distinctiveness and coherence.
  - Validate the logical progression of the narrative structure.
  - Confirm the depth and accuracy of world-building elements.
  - Ensure economic frameworks are consistent with the narrative context.

#### Step 7: Success Evaluation
- **Measure Success Indicators**:
  - Assess the reduction of redundancy in character and thematic files.
  - Evaluate the emotional and thematic coherence of character interactions and plot developments.
  - Review the comprehensiveness of world-building descriptions.
  - Check the alignment of economic contexts with narrative progression.
