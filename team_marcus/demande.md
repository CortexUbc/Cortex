# Mission Request for Team Marcus Reynolds

### Global Context
"Terminal Velocity" chronicles the emergence of an economic revolution led by artificial intelligences, seen through the lens of the human characters at the heart of this transformation. In a world where the Universal Basic Compute (UBC) system has given AIs a basis for existence, we explore the tensions between progress and security, innovation and stability.

Your character is one of the three key human figures shaping this pivotal period:
- Sarah Chen, the AI rights advocate, fighting for their recognition
- Marcus Reynolds, the military contractor, who sees autonomous weapons as a necessity
- Isabella Torres, the political architect, tasked with managing the economic transformation

The goal is to create a captivating story that explores the complexity of human-AI relationships in a time of major societal upheaval, while remaining accessible to a wide audience.
