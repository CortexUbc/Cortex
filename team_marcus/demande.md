# Project Demand

## Overview
This project aims to develop an intelligent system capable of managing communication between different autonomous agents. The objective is to improve the efficiency and collaboration between these agents to accomplish complex missions.

## Stakeholder Expectations
- **Efficiency**: The system must reduce the time required to complete missions.
  - **Measurement**: Track the average time taken to complete missions before and after implementation, aiming for a reduction of at least 30%.
- **Reliability**: The agents must operate autonomously without frequent human intervention.
  - **Measurement**: Monitor the frequency of human interventions required per mission, targeting a reduction of at least 50%.
- **Scalability**: The system must be able to integrate new agents and functionalities without requiring major modifications.
  - **Measurement**: Evaluate the time and resources needed to integrate new agents, aiming for a process that takes no longer than 2 weeks.

## Success Criteria
1. **Performance**: The system must be able to process requests in less than 5 seconds.
2. **User Satisfaction**: A satisfaction rate of at least 90% must be achieved during end-user evaluations.
3. **Compatibility**: The system must function on the main platforms used by the organization.
