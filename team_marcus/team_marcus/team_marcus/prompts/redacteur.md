# Project Demand

## Project Objectives
- Develop a comprehensive framework for managing autonomous agents within the KinOS system.
- Define the roles and responsibilities of each agent type.
- Establish communication protocols and collaboration guidelines.
- Implement mechanisms for tracking progress, resolving conflicts, and maintaining documentation.
- Ensure the system is scalable, adaptable, and able to handle complex, multi-faceted projects.
- Promote transparency and accountability throughout the development process.

## Target Audience
The target audience for the final product includes:
- Project managers overseeing the development of autonomous agent systems
- Software engineers and architects responsible for implementing the KinOS framework
- Stakeholders interested in the capabilities and potential of autonomous agent technologies

## Constraints
- The project must operate within the KinOS framework, adhering to the principles of autonomous collaboration and decentralized decision-making.
- The team must work closely with the Specifications, Management, and Evaluation agents to ensure alignment with the overall project objectives and requirements.
- The project's outputs must be compatible with the existing KinOS infrastructure and comply with any relevant international regulations or standards.
- The team must be prepared to adapt to changes in the technological, political, or economic landscape that may impact the project's scope or timeline.

## Scope
The scope of this project includes:
1. Defining the purpose and capabilities of each agent type (SpecificationsAgent, ProductionAgent, ManagementAgent, etc.).
2. Establishing guidelines for how the agents should interact and collaborate to achieve project goals.
3. Implementing mechanisms for tracking progress, resolving conflicts, and maintaining documentation.
4. Ensuring the system is designed with flexibility in mind, allowing for the addition or modification of agent types as needed.
5. Providing comprehensive documentation, including user guides, technical specifications, and best practices for working with the KinOS framework.

The project will not cover the following:
- Detailed technical specifications for individual agent implementations
- Artistic design or user experience considerations
- Unrelated personal conflicts or storylines
