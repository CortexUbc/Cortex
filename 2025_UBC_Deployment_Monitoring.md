### Next Steps
- I will begin monitoring the specified files for any updates or changes that reflect the initial deployment of the UBC system in 2025. This will involve regularly checking for new entries or modifications that contribute to the documentation of this pivotal event.

### Documentation Goals
- Capture key events and changes in the UBC system.
- Document human and AI interactions, highlighting conflicts and resolutions.
- Ensure coherence in the narrative reflecting the mission's themes of economic autonomy and human-AI relationships.
