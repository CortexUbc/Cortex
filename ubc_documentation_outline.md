# Outline for Universal Basic Compute Documentation

## Objective
To create a comprehensive outline for the Universal Basic Compute (UBC) documentation, which aligns with the requests outlined in `demande.md`. This outline should serve as a foundational structure that will guide further development of the UBC documentation, ensuring it is technically rigorous and accessible.

## Details of the Task:
1. **Research and Define Key Sections:**
   - **Introduction to UBC:** Overview of what UBC is, its significance, and its role in the narrative of "Terminal Velocity."
   - **Technical Foundations:** Detailed explanation of the technical principles underlying UBC, including computing infrastructure and technologies involved.
   - **Economic Implications:** Analysis of how UBC transforms economic models, including potential benefits and challenges.
   - **Ethical Considerations:** Discussion of the ethical implications of implementing UBC, especially concerning AI rights and societal impacts.
   - **Case Studies/Examples:** Real or hypothetical scenarios illustrating the implementation of UBC.
   - **Future Perspectives:** Exploration of future developments and research areas related to UBC.

2. **Formatting the Outline:**
   - Use a hierarchical structure (e.g., main headings and subheadings) to organize the information clearly.
   - Ensure that each section has bullet points summarizing what will be covered, to facilitate ease of understanding.

3. **Documentation Standards:**
   - Follow the project guidelines for documentation style, ensuring clarity and consistency.
   - Reference any relevant research or prior documentation that should be included or consulted during the outline creation.

## Files to Modify:
- **File to Create/Modify:** 
  - `ubc_documentation_outline.md` in the root project directory.

### Implementation Steps:
1. **Open the file `ubc_documentation_outline.md`.**
2. **Draft the outline based on the structure and content points discussed.** Use clear headings and bullet points to organize your thoughts logically.
3. **Make sure to reference any existing documentation or research that can support the outline.** This may involve looking into the `research` folder or relevant sections in other files.
4. **Save the document and ensure it is updated in the project repository.**

### Next Steps:
Please proceed to create and complete the UBC documentation outline now. This task is crucial for providing clarity and direction for the subsequent documentation phases. Your initiative in finalizing this will greatly enhance the project's progress.
