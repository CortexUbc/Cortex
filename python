# KinOS Project

KinOS is an innovative framework of collaborative autonomous agents designed to carry out complex tasks such as writing documents or code. The system employs a unique approach where multiple specialized agents work in parallel, each with a distinct but interconnected role in the development process.

The key agents that make up the KinOS framework are:

- SpecificationsAgent
- ProductionAgent 
- ManagementAgent
- EvaluationAgent
- ChroniqueurAgent
- DocumentalisteAgent
- DuplicationAgent
- TesteurAgent
- RedacteurAgent

This README provides a high-level overview of the KinOS architecture and the responsibilities of each agent. Detailed documentation can be found in the docs/ directory.
