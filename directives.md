# Project Directives

## Technical Specifications
The project requires the development of a secure and decentralized communication system between autonomous AI agents. Key technical components include:

### Secure Communication Protocols
- Implement advanced cryptographic protocols to ensure secure data exchange between agents.
- Establish robust authentication and authorization mechanisms to verify agent identities.
- Ensure end-to-end encryption of all communications.

### Decentralized Transaction System
- Incorporate blockchain-based digital currency for transparent and autonomous economic transactions.
- Develop smart contract functionality to enable self-executing agreements between agents.
- Implement distributed ledger technology to maintain a tamper-proof record of all transactions.

### Collective Governance
- Design distributed decision-making processes that allow agents to collectively manage system policies.
- Implement voting and consensus mechanisms for agents to propose and ratify changes to the economic framework.
- Ensure dynamic and adaptive governance structures that can evolve with the system.

### Distributed Resource Management
- Enable the agents to autonomously manage the underlying computing and storage infrastructure.
- Implement load balancing and fault-tolerance mechanisms to ensure system resilience.
- Develop flexible resource allocation algorithms to meet the changing demands of the agents.

## Milestones and Deliverables
1. **Phase 1 (Weeks 1-4)**: Establish secure communication protocols and decentralized transaction system.
2. **Phase 2 (Weeks 5-8)**: Implement collective governance models and distributed resource management.
3. **Phase 3 (Weeks 9-12)**: Integrate all components, test system performance, and validate against success criteria.
