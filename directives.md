## Validation Mechanisms

### State Validation Processes
- **New Criteria**: Introduce additional integrity checks based on the analysis of character interactions and economic policies.
- **Collaborative Dynamics**: Ensure that validation mechanisms reflect the collaborative nature of agent interactions, enhancing data integrity across the system.

## Objective for Duplication Agent

1. **Action Statement**
   - Duplicate the character profile of Isabella Torres, ensuring that her backstory and interaction mechanisms are accurately replicated for integration into the narrative system.

2. **Source Files**
   - Analyze the following files:
     - `demande.md` (focus on sections detailing Isabella Torres's character attributes, backstory, and interaction mechanisms)
     - `directives.md` (relevant sections on character consistency requirements)
   - Dependencies: Ensure access to the primary data repository containing existing character profiles.

3. **Target Changes**
   - Modify the character profile file for Isabella Torres.
   - Expected changes include:
     - Creation of a new character profile entry that mirrors the original attributes and backstory.
     - Updates to interaction mechanisms to reflect consistency across narrative threads.
   - Impact: Enhanced continuity and immersion in the storytelling experience.

4. **Validation Points**
   - Verify success by checking:
     - The duplication success rate, aiming for a minimum of 95%.
     - Ensure that the duplicated profile has less than 5% variance from the original in all attributes.
     - Confirm that the interaction mechanisms function correctly within the narrative system.

5. **Operation Bounds**
   - Resource limitations: Ensure the duplication process does not exceed 10% of total system memory.
   - Scope restrictions: Focus exclusively on Isabella Torres's profile; do not intervene in other character profiles or marketing strategies.
   - Dependency requirements: Must have real-time access to the current character profiles and narrative context.
