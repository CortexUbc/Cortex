## Validation Mechanisms

### State Validation Processes
- **New Criteria**: Introduce additional integrity checks based on the analysis of character interactions and economic policies.
- **Collaborative Dynamics**: Ensure that validation mechanisms reflect the collaborative nature of agent interactions, enhancing data integrity across the system.

## Objective for Duplication Agent

1. **Action Statement**
   - Duplicate the character profile of Isabella Torres by extracting her updated attributes, backstory, and interaction mechanisms to ensure consistency across various narrative threads in the Terminal Velocity project.

1. **Action Statement**
   - Duplicate the character profile of Isabella Torres by extracting her updated attributes, backstory, and interaction mechanisms to ensure consistency across various narrative threads in the Terminal Velocity project.

2. **Source Files**
   - Analyze the `demande.md` file for the current character attributes of Isabella Torres, focusing on sections detailing her personality traits, motivations, and interactions with other characters.
   - Review the `aider.agent.duplication.md` file for the operational guidelines and duplication protocols relevant to character replication.

3. **Target Changes**
   - Modify the `character_profiles.md` file to include the new duplications of Isabella Torres, ensuring the profile reflects all attributes accurately and adheres to the quality standards specified in the duplication agent configuration.
   - Expected changes should include a complete character profile entry for Isabella Torres, along with all associated interaction mechanisms.

4. **Validation Points**
   - Verify success by checking the output in `character_profiles.md` to ensure that the duplication retains a success rate of at least 95% and that all attributes match the original profile from `demande.md` with less than 5% variance.
   - Confirm that the required validation checks against the original data have been completed without discrepancies.

5. **Operation Bounds**
   - Resource limitations include maintaining processing time under 3 seconds for the duplication task.
   - Scope restrictions focus solely on the duplication of Isabella Torres and do not extend to modifications of other characters or narrative elements.
   - Dependency requirements involve access to the most current version of `demande.md` and the duplication protocols outlined in `aider.agent.duplication.md`.

1. **Action Statement**
   - Duplicate the character profile of Isabella Torres, ensuring that her backstory and interaction mechanisms are accurately replicated for integration into the narrative system.

2. **Source Files**
   - Analyze the following files:
     - `demande.md` (focus on sections detailing Isabella Torres's character attributes, backstory, and interaction mechanisms)
     - `directives.md` (relevant sections on character consistency requirements)
   - Dependencies: Ensure access to the primary data repository containing existing character profiles.

3. **Target Changes**
   - Modify the character profile file for Isabella Torres.
   - Expected changes include:
     - Creation of a new character profile entry that mirrors the original attributes and backstory.
     - Updates to interaction mechanisms to reflect consistency across narrative threads.
   - Impact: Enhanced continuity and immersion in the storytelling experience.

4. **Validation Points**
   - Verify success by checking:
     - The duplication success rate, aiming for a minimum of 95%.
     - Ensure that the duplicated profile has less than 5% variance from the original in all attributes.
     - Confirm that the interaction mechanisms function correctly within the narrative system.

5. **Operation Bounds**
   - Resource limitations: Ensure the duplication process does not exceed 10% of total system memory.
   - Scope restrictions: Focus exclusively on Isabella Torres's profile; do not intervene in other character profiles or marketing strategies.
   - Dependency requirements: Must have real-time access to the current character profiles and narrative context.
