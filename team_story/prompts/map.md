## Overview

## Key Components
## Overview
KinOS is an innovative framework of collaborative autonomous agents designed to carry out missions independently, such as writing a complex document or codebase. It employs a unique approach where multiple specialized agents work in parallel, each having a distinct but interconnected role in the development process.

## Key Components
- **SpecificationsAgent**: Analyzes initial requests, defines technical requirements, and maintains specification consistency throughout the project.
- **ProductionAgent**: Generates and optimizes code or text, implements requests to achieve the mission objectives.
- **ManagementAgent**: Coordinates activities, manages priorities, and tracks project progress.
- **EvaluationAgent**: Performs testing, validates quality, and measures the performance of the produced content.
- **ChroniqueurAgent**: Ensures logging of activities, change traceability, and generates progress reports.
- **DocumentalisteAgent**: Maintains consistency between content and documentation, analyzes and updates existing documentation.
- **DuplicationAgent**: Detects and reduces duplication in content, identifies similar functions, and proposes improvements.
- **TesteurAgent**: Creates and maintains tests, executes test suites, and identifies potential issues.
- **RedacteurAgent**: Updates textual content, ensures style consistency and writing quality.
