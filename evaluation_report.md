# Evaluation Report

## Objective for Evaluation Agent

## Action Statement
Conduct a comprehensive performance evaluation of the autonomous agents responsible for managing communication protocols, focusing specifically on their response times and reliability metrics.

## Source Files
- **Files to Analyze**: 
  - `demande.md`
  - `directives.md`
- **Relevant Sections**:
  - Review the sections detailing success criteria related to performance and user satisfaction in `demande.md`.
  - Check the guidelines and expectations outlined in `directives.md` for evaluation metrics and criteria.

## Target Changes
- **Files to Modify**:
  - `evaluation_report.md`
- **Nature of Expected Changes**: 
  - Add a new section summarizing the performance metrics of the agents based on the evaluation conducted.
  - Include recommendations for optimizing communication protocols to achieve the performance benchmarks specified.
- **Impact on System State**: 
  - Enhanced clarity on agent performance, leading to potential adjustments in protocols for improved efficiency.

## Validation Points
- **How to Verify Success**:
  - Ensure that the evaluation report accurately reflects the performance data collected during the assessment.
- **What Output to Check**:
  - Review the new section in `evaluation_report.md` for completeness and adherence to the established success criteria.
- **Which States to Validate**:
  - Validate that the average response time recorded in the report is under 5 seconds and that reliability metrics show a reduction in human intervention by at least 50%.

## Operation Bounds
- **Resource Limitations**: 
  - The evaluation must be completed within the next 2 weeks to align with project timelines.
- **Scope Restrictions**: 
  - Focus solely on response times and reliability; do not evaluate other performance aspects or agent interactions at this stage.
- **Dependency Requirements**: 
  - Access to real-time performance data from the agents during the evaluation period is required for accuracy.
