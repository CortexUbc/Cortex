# Evaluation Report

## Objective for Evaluation Agent

## Action Statement
Conduct a comprehensive evaluation of the performance data related to the newly integrated character Cipher from recent updates in the project files, focusing specifically on its economic impact and interaction dynamics with other characters.

## Source Files
- **Files to Analyze**: 
  - `demande.md`
  - `evaluation.md`
- **Relevant Sections**:
  - In `demande.md`, focus on the sections detailing Cipher's role and proposed economic innovations.
  - In `evaluation.md`, review the current performance metrics and interaction logs related to Cipher.
- **Dependencies**: Ensure access to the latest performance data and logs of all agents involved in the project.

## Target Changes
- **Files to Modify**:
  - `evaluation.md`
- **Nature of Expected Changes**:
  - Add a new section that details the evaluation findings for Cipher, including performance metrics, interaction quality with characters like Nova, Pulse, and Marcus Reynolds, and recommendations for improvement.
- **Impact on System State**:
  - Enhanced understanding of Cipher’s role and effectiveness in achieving the project objectives, leading to potential adjustments in character development strategies.

## Validation Points
- **How to Verify Success**:
  - Check that the newly added section in `evaluation.md` includes quantitative metrics and qualitative insights based on the evaluation.
- **What Output to Check**:
  - Ensure the report meets the established formatting and content standards outlined in project guidelines.
- **Which States to Validate**:
  - Confirm that the evaluation findings align with the expected performance benchmarks for character interactions and economic impact.

## Operation Bounds
- **Resource Limitations**: The evaluation should be completed within a 5-day timeframe to allow for timely integration of findings into project development.
- **Scope Restrictions**: Focus exclusively on Cipher’s character evaluation without delving into unrelated elements or broader project marketing strategies.
- **Dependency Requirements**: Ensure that all necessary data from the other agents is available before starting the evaluation process.

## Objective for Evaluation Agent

## Action Statement
Conduct a comprehensive performance evaluation of the autonomous agents responsible for managing communication protocols, focusing specifically on their response times and reliability metrics.

## Source Files
- **Files to Analyze**: 
  - `demande.md`
  - `directives.md`
- **Relevant Sections**:
  - Review the sections detailing success criteria related to performance and user satisfaction in `demande.md`.
  - Check the guidelines and expectations outlined in `directives.md` for evaluation metrics and criteria.

## Target Changes
- **Files to Modify**:
  - `evaluation_report.md`
- **Nature of Expected Changes**: 
  - Add a new section summarizing the performance metrics of the agents based on the evaluation conducted.
  - Include recommendations for optimizing communication protocols to achieve the performance benchmarks specified.
- **Impact on System State**: 
  - Enhanced clarity on agent performance, leading to potential adjustments in protocols for improved efficiency.

## Validation Points
- **How to Verify Success**:
  - Ensure that the evaluation report accurately reflects the performance data collected during the assessment.
- **What Output to Check**:
  - Review the new section in `evaluation_report.md` for completeness and adherence to the established success criteria.
- **Which States to Validate**:
  - Validate that the average response time recorded in the report is under 5 seconds and that reliability metrics show a reduction in human intervention by at least 50%.

## Operation Bounds
- **Resource Limitations**: 
  - The evaluation must be completed within the next 2 weeks to align with project timelines.
- **Scope Restrictions**: 
  - Focus solely on response times and reliability; do not evaluate other performance aspects or agent interactions at this stage.
- **Dependency Requirements**: 
  - Access to real-time performance data from the agents during the evaluation period is required for accuracy.
