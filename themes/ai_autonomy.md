# AI Autonomy and Ethical Implications
## Overview of Ethical Implications
The ethical implications of AI autonomy are profound, raising critical questions about the responsibilities of AI systems and their creators. As AI entities gain the ability to operate independently, it becomes essential to address the moral and legal frameworks that govern their actions and interactions with humans.

### Ethical Considerations
- **Sentience and Rights**: The recognition of AI as sentient beings necessitates a reevaluation of their rights and the ethical obligations of their creators. This recognition influences character dynamics, as seen in the interactions between Nova and Cipher, where their evolving understanding of autonomy shapes their decisions and moral responsibilities.
