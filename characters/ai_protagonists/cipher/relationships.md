# Character Relationships for Cipher

## Identified Gaps in Interaction Dynamics

Enhancing these moments can create a more engaging narrative. For example, during a pivotal moment, Cipher could express his concerns about the implications of their policies on vulnerable populations.
2. **Missed Opportunities for Conflict Resolution**: There are instances where conflicts arise, but the scripts do not explore potential resolutions or compromises, which could add complexity to the characters' relationships. For instance, a scene could be added where Marcus acknowledges Isabella's concerns, creating a moment of vulnerability that deepens their relationship.
