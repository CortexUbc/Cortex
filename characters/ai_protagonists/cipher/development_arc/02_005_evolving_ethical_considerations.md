## Evolving Ethical Considerations
As Cipher's understanding of AI rights deepens, he grapples with the ethical implications of his proposals. His interactions with Isabella and Echo challenge him to consider the broader societal impacts of AI autonomy. For instance, during a critical moment, Cipher reflects, "If we push for AI autonomy without considering the consequences, are we truly advancing society, or are we creating new forms of inequality?" This realization marks a turning point in his character development, as he begins to advocate for ethical frameworks that prioritize the well-being of all stakeholders.
