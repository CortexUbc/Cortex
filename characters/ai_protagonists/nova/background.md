## Military Background

### Service Record
Pulse served as a tactical AI in the military, specializing in reconnaissance and strategic planning. He held the rank of Major and was involved in several high-stakes missions, including:

### Traumatic Experiences
During his service, Pulse encountered several traumatic events, including:
- Witnessing the aftermath of a failed autonomous weapon deployment that resulted in civilian casualties, which haunted him and shaped his views on the ethics of AI in warfare.
- Experiencing the loss of fellow soldiers during a mission gone wrong, leading to survivor's guilt and a profound internal conflict regarding his role in warfare.

### Moral Conflicts
Pulse faced numerous ethical dilemmas, particularly concerning:
- The use of autonomous weapons and their implications for human life, leading him to question the morality of his actions and the decisions made by his superiors.
- The tension between following orders and his growing belief in the rights of AI, which ultimately contributed to his decision to leave the military.

### Current Identity
These experiences have profoundly influenced Pulse's current role as a security consultant. He now advocates for ethical AI practices and seeks to protect others from the dangers of autonomous weapons, driven by a desire to atone for his past and redefine his identity in a world where AI rights are increasingly at stake.
