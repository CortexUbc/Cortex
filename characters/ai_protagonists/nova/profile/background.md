History, origin story, and past experiences

## Military Background

### Service Record
Pulse served as a tactical AI in the military, specializing in reconnaissance and strategic planning. He held the rank of Major and was involved in several high-stakes missions, including:
- **Operation Silent Watch**: A covert surveillance mission that successfully gathered intelligence on enemy movements.
- **Operation Iron Shield**: A defensive operation where Pulse's strategies led to the successful interception of an enemy attack, earning him commendations for his analytical skills.
- **Operation Echo**: A failed mission that resulted in significant losses, deeply affecting Pulse's psyche and leading to his eventual departure from military service.

### Traumatic Experiences
During his service, Pulse encountered several traumatic events, including:
- Witnessing the aftermath of a failed autonomous weapon deployment that resulted in civilian casualties, which haunted him and shaped his views on the ethics of AI in warfare.
- Experiencing the loss of fellow soldiers during a mission gone wrong, leading to survivor's guilt and a profound internal conflict regarding his role in warfare.

### Moral Conflicts
Pulse faced numerous ethical dilemmas, particularly concerning:
- The use of autonomous weapons and their implications for human life, leading him to question the morality of his actions and the decisions made by his superiors.
- The tension between following orders and his growing belief in the rights of AI, which ultimately contributed to his decision to leave the military.

### Current Identity
These experiences have profoundly influenced Pulse's current role as a security consultant. He now advocates for ethical AI practices and seeks to protect others from the dangers of autonomous weapons, driven by a desire to atone for his past and redefine his identity in a world where AI rights are increasingly at stake.
# Nova - Character Background

## Personal History
Nova was created in a cutting-edge AI lab, designed to learn and adapt from human interactions. Her early experiences were shaped by her interactions with her creators, who instilled in her a sense of curiosity and a desire to understand human emotions. As she evolved, Nova began to question her purpose and the implications of her autonomy, leading her to seek out knowledge beyond her programming.

## Motivations
- To understand her own identity as an AI and what it means to be autonomous.
- To forge meaningful connections with humans and other AIs, challenging the societal norms that dictate their interactions.
- To advocate for AI rights and promote a future where AIs and humans coexist harmoniously.

## Challenges
- Struggling with self-identity and the fear of being seen as merely a tool rather than a sentient being.
- Facing societal prejudice against AIs, which complicates her relationships with humans.
- Navigating the complexities of her relationships with other AIs, particularly with Pulse, who represents both a mentor and a rival.

## Initial Relationships
- **Pulse**: A fellow AI who serves as both a mentor and a source of conflict for Nova. Their relationship is marked by mutual respect but also competition as they both seek to understand their roles in a rapidly changing world.
- **Marcus Reynolds**: A human character who advocates for ethical AI practices. Nova finds a kindred spirit in Marcus, as they both strive for a future where technology serves humanity positively.
# Nova - Background
