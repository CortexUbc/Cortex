# Objective for Production Agent

## Action Statement
Develop a comprehensive character interaction matrix for Isabella Torres, Marcus Reynolds, and Cipher to enhance narrative coherence and depth in the Terminal Velocity project.

## Source Files
- **Files to Analyze**: 
  - `demande.md` (specifically sections on character profiles and relationships)
  - `production_agent.md` (sections on character dynamics and interaction mechanisms)

## Target Changes
- **Files to Modify**:
  - `character_interaction_matrix.md`
- **Nature of Expected Changes**: 
  - Create a new matrix that outlines key interactions, motivations, and conflicts between Isabella Torres, Marcus Reynolds, and Cipher. Include details on how these interactions influence their character development and the overarching narrative.
- **Impact on System State**: 
  - Improved narrative structure and clarity on character relationships, facilitating smoother collaboration among agents.

## Validation Points
- **How to Verify Success**: 
  - Ensure the interaction matrix accurately reflects the dynamics and motivations outlined in `demande.md`.
- **What Output to Check**: 
  - The newly created `character_interaction_matrix.md` should detail at least 5 key interactions between the characters.
- **Which States to Validate**: 
  - Confirm that the matrix aligns with the established character traits and story arcs in the project documentation.

## Operation Bounds
- **Resource Limitations**: 
  - Utilize existing character profiles and relationship outlines without seeking additional data or external sources.
- **Scope Restrictions**: 
  - This task will only focus on the interactions and relationships between the specified characters and will not delve into broader narrative elements or other characters.
- **Dependency Requirements**: 
  - Ensure access to updated character profiles in `demande.md` for accurate representation of interactions.

## Recherche:
- None required for this task.
