## Scene 3: Climactic Confrontation
*Setting: A public forum where both are presenting their views.*

**Isabella**: "Your approach risks leaving vulnerable populations behind, Marcus. We need to ensure that technology serves everyone, not just the privileged. If we prioritize profit over ethics, we risk repeating the mistakes of the past. We must advocate for those who have no voice. This isn't just about technology; it's about the people who will be affected by our decisions."

**Marcus**: "And we need to protect our nation first. If we don't act decisively, we risk everything we've built. But I hear you, Isabella; we must find a way to integrate ethical considerations into our strategies. I just worry that if we slow down, we might miss the opportunity to lead in this new era."

**Isabella**: "But at what cost? We can't sacrifice our values for short-term gains. We must advocate for those who have no voice. If we ignore the ethical implications now, we may create a future where technology serves only a select few."
