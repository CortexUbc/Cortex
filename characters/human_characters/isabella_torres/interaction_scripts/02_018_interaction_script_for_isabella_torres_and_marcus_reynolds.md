# Interaction Script for Isabella Torres and Marcus Reynolds

- **Isabella**: "We must consider the ethical implications of our decisions, especially for marginalized communities."
- **Marcus**: "I understand your concerns, but we must act decisively to protect our nation. We can't let idealism cloud our judgment. However, I recognize the importance of including those voices in our strategy."
- **Isabella**: "Exactly! Our choices could uplift or harm those we aim to protect. We must be mindful of the long-term effects and the lives at stake."
- **Marcus**: "You're right. We need to find a balance that respects both progress and the needs of the people affected by our decisions. Let's collaborate to create a plan that addresses both security and social equity."
