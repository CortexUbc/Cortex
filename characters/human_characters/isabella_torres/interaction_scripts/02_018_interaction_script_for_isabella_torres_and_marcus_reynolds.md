# Interaction Script for Isabella Torres and Marcus Reynolds

- **Isabella**: "We must consider the implications of our actions on marginalized communities. If we prioritize economic efficiency over social justice, we risk leaving them behind."
- **Marcus**: "I understand your concerns, but we must act decisively to protect our nation. We can't let idealism cloud our judgment."
- **Isabella**: "What about our ethical responsibilities? Our choices could uplift or harm those we aim to protect."
- **Marcus**: "You're right. We need to find a balance that respects both progress and the needs of the people affected by our decisions."
