# Interaction Script for Isabella Torres and Marcus Reynolds

- **Isabella**: "If we prioritize profit over ethics, we risk repeating the mistakes of the past. We must advocate for a future where ethical considerations guide our actions."
- **Marcus**: "I understand your concerns, but we must also consider the broader implications of our decisions. It's not just about today; it's about the legacy we leave behind."
- **Isabella**: "Sometimes I wonder if my push for ethical AI is too idealistic. Can we truly balance innovation with the needs of society?"
- **Marcus**: "I want to protect our future, but I fear the consequences of our decisions on those who are already vulnerable."
