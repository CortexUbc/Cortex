# Interaction Script for Isabella Torres and Marcus Reynolds

- **Isabella**: "We must prioritize the rights of AI; they deserve a voice in this conversation, especially in light of the ethical implications."
- **Marcus**: "But we can't ignore the security risks involved; we need to find a balance that protects everyone."
- **Marcus**: "What about the implications of our decisions on society as a whole? We have to think about the future."
- **Isabella**: "Every decision we make impacts lives; we must consider the marginalized and ensure their voices are heard."
- **Isabella**: "If we don't advocate for them, who will? It's our responsibility to lead this change."
- **Marcus**: "I understand your passion, but we need to be pragmatic and consider the broader consequences."
