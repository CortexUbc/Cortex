# Interaction Script for Isabella Torres and Marcus Reynolds

- **Isabella**: "We must consider the implications of our actions on marginalized communities. If we prioritize economic efficiency over social justice, we risk leaving them behind. We need to ensure that our decisions uplift those who are often overlooked."
- **Marcus**: "I understand your concerns, but we must act decisively to protect our nation. We can't let idealism cloud our judgment. However, I see the importance of including those voices in our strategy."
- **Isabella**: "What about our ethical responsibilities? Our choices could uplift or harm those we aim to protect. We have to be mindful of the long-term effects."
- **Marcus**: "You're right. We need to find a balance that respects both progress and the needs of the people affected by our decisions. Let's work together to create a plan that addresses both security and social equity."
