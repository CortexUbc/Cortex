## Scene 1: Ethical Dilemma
*Setting: A conference room filled with stakeholders discussing AI regulations. The atmosphere is tense as Isabella prepares to present her views on the ethical implications of AI policies.*

**Isabella**: "We must prioritize ethical considerations in our AI policies. If we ignore the potential for exploitation, we risk repeating the mistakes of the past. This is why I advocate for decentralized resource allocationâ€”it's essential for ensuring fairness."

**Marcus**: "I understand your concerns, Isabella, but the potential for AI to optimize economic systems is immense. We need to embrace this change rather than fear it. However, I see your point about the need for safeguards to protect those who might be left behind."

**Marcus**: "I understand your concerns, Isabella, but we need to focus on the benefits AI can bring to our economy. Security and efficiency should come first."
