## Scene 1: Ethical Dilemma
*Setting: A conference room filled with stakeholders discussing AI regulations.*

**Isabella**: "We must prioritize ethical considerations in our AI policies. If we ignore the potential for exploitation, we risk repeating the mistakes of the past. This is why I advocate for decentralized resource allocationâ€”it's essential for ensuring fairness."

**Isabella**: "We need to ensure that our economic policies reflect the needs of marginalized communities. If we prioritize efficiency over equity, we risk deepening existing inequalities."

**Marcus**: "I understand your concerns, Isabella, but we need to focus on the benefits AI can bring to our economy. Security and efficiency should come first."
