*Setting: A conference room where Isabella and Marcus are discussing the implications of AI in economic policies. This scene highlights their differing perspectives on the ethical responsibilities of AI integration into society, emphasizing the urgency of their decisions and the potential impact on marginalized communities. This is a new addition to enhance the ethical confrontation.*

**Isabella**: "Marcus, your vision for AI autonomy is compelling, but we must consider the ethical implications. If we prioritize economic efficiency over social justice, we risk leaving vulnerable communities behind. We have a responsibility to ensure that our policies uplift everyone, not just the privileged. The stakes are too high, and I fear that if we don't act now, we may lose the opportunity to create a just system. We need to ensure that our advancements uplift everyone, not just the privileged."

**Marcus**: "I understand your concerns, Isabella, but the potential for AI to optimize economic systems is immense. We need to embrace this change rather than fear it. However, I see your point about the need for safeguards to protect those who might be left behind. It's a delicate balance we must strike."

**Isabella**: "But at what cost? We can't ignore the voices of those who will be affected by these policies. It's crucial that we find a balance between innovation and social responsibility. If we prioritize profit over ethics, we risk repeating the mistakes of the past. We must advocate for those who have no voice. I fear that if we don't act now, we may lose the opportunity to create a just system. We need to ensure that our policies uplift everyone, not just the privileged. The future of our society depends on it."

**Marcus**: "I see your point, but we also need to think about the bigger picture. If we don't act decisively, we risk falling behind in the global economy. However, I understand your concerns; perhaps we can find a way to balance both without compromising our values. It's a challenge, but one we must face together. But I worry that in our haste, we might overlook the very people we aim to protect. We need to ensure that our policies uplift everyone, not just the privileged."

**Isabella**: "Falling behind shouldn't come at the expense of our values. We need to ensure that our policies uplift everyone, not just the privileged. We must advocate for those who have no voice. Our future depends on it. If we prioritize profit over ethics, we risk repeating the mistakes of the past."
