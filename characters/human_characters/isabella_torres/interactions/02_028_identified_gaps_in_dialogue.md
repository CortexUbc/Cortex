## Identified Gaps in Dialogue
1. **Lack of Emotional Depth**: Current interactions do not fully explore the emotional stakes involved in Isabella's relationships with Marcus. Enhancing these moments can create a more engaging narrative.
2. **Missed Opportunities for Conflict Resolution**: There are instances where conflicts arise, but the scripts do not explore potential resolutions or compromises, which could add complexity to the characters' relationships.
3. **Underdeveloped Collaborative Moments**: While there are collaborative scenes, they often lack detail on how the characters negotiate their differences, which is crucial for character development.
