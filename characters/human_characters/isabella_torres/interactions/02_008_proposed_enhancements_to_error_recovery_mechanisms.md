## Proposed Enhancements to Error Recovery Mechanisms
1. **Real-Time Monitoring**: Implement real-time monitoring for communication failures to enable immediate response and logging of incidents.
2. **Comprehensive Protocols**: Develop comprehensive error recovery protocols that minimize downtime and ensure quick restoration of services, including predefined failover strategies.
3. **Feedback Loop**: Introduce a feedback loop for agents to report on the effectiveness of error handling protocols, allowing for continuous improvement.
