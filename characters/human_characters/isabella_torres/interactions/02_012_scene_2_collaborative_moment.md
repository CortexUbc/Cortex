## Scene 2: Collaborative Moment
*Setting: A quiet caf√© after a long day of meetings.*

**Isabella**: "Maybe we can find a middle ground. What if we propose a policy that includes safeguards for marginalized communities? It's crucial that we ensure our advancements don't leave anyone behind. We have a responsibility to protect those who are most at risk from our decisions."

**Marcus**: "That could work. If we frame it as a way to enhance security while promoting equity, it might gain traction. But we need to ensure that our approach doesn't compromise the very communities we're trying to protect. I worry that without careful consideration, we might inadvertently harm those we intend to help."

**Isabella**: "Exactly! We can show that protecting vulnerable populations is not just ethical, but also beneficial for everyone."

**Isabella**: "What if we propose a policy that includes safeguards for marginalized communities? It could enhance our security narrative while promoting equity. I believe that by prioritizing these voices, we can create a more just economic landscape. We have to be proactive in addressing these issues."
