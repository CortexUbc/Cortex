# Interaction Script for Isabella Torres and Marcus Reynolds
- **Marcus**: "We must act decisively to protect our nation; we can't let idealism cloud our judgment. Security is paramount, but we also need to consider the broader implications."
- **Isabella**: "What about the ethical implications of our decisions? We must consider the impact on marginalized communities and ensure their voices are included. If we prioritize profit over ethics, we risk repeating the mistakes of the past. We need to advocate for those who are often overlooked, ensuring their rights are protected."
- **Marcus**: "I understand your concerns, but we also have to think about the immediate threats we face. It's a delicate balance."
- **Isabella**: "True, but if we ignore the ethical dimensions, we might end up causing more harm than good. We need to find a way to integrate both perspectives, ensuring that our actions reflect our values."
