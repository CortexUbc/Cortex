# Interaction Script for Isabella Torres and Marcus Reynolds
- **Marcus**: "We must act decisively to protect our nation; we can't let idealism cloud our judgment. Security is paramount."
- **Isabella**: "What about the ethical implications of our decisions? We must consider the impact on marginalized communities and ensure their voices are included. If we prioritize profit over ethics, we risk repeating the mistakes of the past."
