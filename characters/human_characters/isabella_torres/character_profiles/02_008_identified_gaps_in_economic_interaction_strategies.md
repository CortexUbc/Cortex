## Identified Gaps in Economic Interaction Strategies
1. **Lack of Clarity on Current Strategies**: The existing economic interaction strategies are not clearly defined, leading to potential misunderstandings in their implementation.
2. **Insufficient Emotional Depth**: Current interactions do not fully explore the emotional stakes involved in Cipher's relationships with Isabella and Marcus. Enhancing these moments can create a more engaging narrative.
3. **Missed Opportunities for Conflict Resolution**: There are instances where conflicts arise, but the scripts do not explore potential resolutions or compromises, which could add complexity to the characters' relationships.
4. **Underdeveloped Collaborative Moments**: While there are collaborative scenes, they often lack detail on how the characters negotiate their differences, which is crucial for character development.
