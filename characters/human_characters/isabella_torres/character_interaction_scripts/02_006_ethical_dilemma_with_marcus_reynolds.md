## Ethical Dilemma with Marcus Reynolds
- **Context**: Isabella faces a decision about supporting a new AI policy that could benefit the economy but may also lead to job losses.
- **Dialogue**:
  - **Isabella**: "Marcus, I understand the potential economic benefits, but what about the people who will lose their jobs? We can't ignore the human cost."
  - **Marcus**: "Isabella, progress often comes with sacrifices. We need to think about the bigger picture."
  - **Isabella**: "But at what cost? If we push this policy through without safeguards, we risk deepening the divide between the privileged and the marginalized."
  - **Isabella**: "I feel torn between the need for innovation and the responsibility to protect those who are vulnerable. How do I advocate for progress without leaving anyone behind?"
