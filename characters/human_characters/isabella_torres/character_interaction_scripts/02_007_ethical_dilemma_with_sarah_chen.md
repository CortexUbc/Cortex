  - **Isabella**: "I agree, but we must also ensure that our policies don't inadvertently harm vulnerable communities. It's a delicate balance."
  - **Sarah**: "Exactly! We canâ€™t let the pursuit of innovation overshadow our responsibility to protect those who are already at risk."
  - **Isabella**: "Sometimes I wonder if my push for ethical AI is too idealistic. Can we truly balance innovation with the needs of society?"
