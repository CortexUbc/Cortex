## Relationships
Marcus' relationships with other key characters in the Terminal Velocity project are complex and multifaceted. He has a long-standing professional relationship with Nova, the lead engineer, and the two often collaborate on the development of new autonomous technologies. However, Marcus' single-minded focus on military applications can sometimes put him at odds with Nova's more holistic approach to innovation. His interactions with Isabella Torres are particularly tense, as they often clash over the ethical implications of the UBC framework and its impact on society.
