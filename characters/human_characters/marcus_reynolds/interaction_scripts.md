# Interaction Script: Updated to reflect Marcus's evolving perspective on ethical responsibility and community impact.
- **Marcus**: "We must act decisively to protect our nation; we can't let idealism cloud our judgment. Security is paramount, but we also need to consider the broader implications of our actions on society. We have a responsibility to ensure that our decisions do not harm those who are already vulnerable. It's crucial that we find a balance between security and ethical responsibility, ensuring our actions reflect our commitment to social equity."
- **Isabella**: "What about the ethical implications of our decisions? We must consider the impact on marginalized communities and ensure their voices are included. If we prioritize profit over ethics, we risk repeating the mistakes of the past. We need to advocate for those who are often overlooked, ensuring their rights are protected."
- **Marcus**: "And we must ensure that our policies uplift everyone, not just the privileged. Our actions must reflect our commitment to social equity."
- **Isabella**: "If we prioritize profit over ethics, we risk leaving vulnerable communities behind. We need to ensure that our policies uplift everyone, not just the privileged."
