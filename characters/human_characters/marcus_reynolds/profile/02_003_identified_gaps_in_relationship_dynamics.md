## Identified Gaps in Relationship Dynamics

1. **Lack of Clarity on Current Strategies**: The existing redundancy strategies are not clearly defined, leading to potential misunderstandings in their implementation.
2. **Insufficient Error Recovery Processes**: Current error recovery mechanisms lack detail, which may hinder effective responses to communication failures.
3. **Need for Comprehensive Protocols**: There is a need for more comprehensive protocols that outline specific steps for error recovery and redundancy management.
4. **Integration of Ethical Confrontations**: The interaction scripts need to better reflect the ethical dilemmas faced by both characters, enhancing their relationship dynamics.
