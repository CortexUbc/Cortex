## Overview
KinOS is an innovative framework of collaborative autonomous agents designed to carry out complex tasks such as writing documents or code. The system employs a unique approach where multiple specialized agents work in parallel, each with a distinct but interconnected role in the development process.

## Key Agent Roles and Responsibilities

### SpecificationsAgent
- Responsible for analyzing initial requests, defining technical requirements, and maintaining specification consistency throughout the project.
- Interacts with other agents to ensure the specifications are aligned with the overall system design and objectives.

### ProductionAgent
- Generates and optimizes code or text, implementing requests to achieve the mission objectives.
- Works closely with the SpecificationsAgent to translate requirements into deliverable content.

### ManagementAgent
- Coordinates the activities of the various agents, manages priorities, and tracks project progress.
- Ensures efficient collaboration and communication between the agents.

### EvaluationAgent
- Performs testing, validates the quality of the produced content, and measures its performance.
- Provides feedback to the other agents to help improve the overall output.

### ChroniqueurAgent
- Ensures logging of activities, maintains change traceability, and generates progress reports.
- Keeps a detailed record of the project's evolution for future reference and analysis.

### DocumentalisteAgent
- Maintains consistency between the content and the documentation, analyzing and updating existing documentation.
- Works to keep the project's documentation accurate and up-to-date.

### DuplicationAgent
- Detects and reduces duplication in the content, identifies similar functions, and proposes improvements.
- Helps to improve the codebase's maintainability and readability.

### TesteurAgent
- Creates and maintains tests, executes test suites, and identifies potential issues.
- Ensures the quality and reliability of the project's deliverables.

### RedacteurAgent
- Updates textual content, ensures style consistency, and maintains writing quality.
- Responsible for the clarity and coherence of the project's written materials.
