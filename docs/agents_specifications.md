# KinOS Agent Specifications

## Introduction to KinOS Agents
The KinOS framework is composed of several specialized agents that collaborate to achieve the objectives of a given project. Each agent has a distinct role and set of responsibilities, but their interactions and coordination are crucial for the successful completion of the mission.

## Agent Descriptions

### SpecificationsAgent
- Responsibilities: Analyzes initial requests, defines technical requirements, and maintains the consistency of specifications throughout the project.
- Behaviors: Gathers information, models requirements, validates specifications, and communicates with other agents.
- Configuration: Requires access to project requirements, stakeholder feedback, and a knowledge base of best practices.

### ProductionAgent
- Responsibilities: Generates and optimizes code or text, implements requests to achieve the mission objectives.
- Behaviors: Processes task assignments, generates content, optimizes for quality and performance, and provides progress updates.
- Configuration: Needs access to the project specifications, development tools, and computing resources.

### ManagementAgent
- Responsibilities: Coordinates activities, manages priorities, and tracks project progress.
- Behaviors: Monitors task status, adjusts priorities, resolves blockers, and communicates with other agents.
- Configuration: Requires access to the project's task management system, resource allocation, and reporting tools.

### EvaluationAgent
- Responsibilities: Performs testing, validates quality, and measures the performance of the produced content.
- Behaviors: Executes test suites, analyzes results, identifies issues, and provides feedback to other agents.
- Configuration: Needs access to the project's test frameworks, quality metrics, and evaluation criteria.

### ChroniqueurAgent
- Responsibilities: Ensures logging of activities, change traceability, and generates progress reports.
- Behaviors: Records project events, tracks modifications, and produces status updates and documentation.
- Configuration: Requires access to the project's version control system, communication channels, and reporting templates.

### DocumentalisteAgent
- Responsibilities: Maintains consistency between content and documentation, analyzes and updates the existing documentation.
- Behaviors: Reviews content, identifies documentation gaps, updates files, and ensures coherence.
- Configuration: Needs access to the project's content, existing documentation, and style guidelines.

### DuplicationAgent
- Responsibilities: Detects and reduces duplication in content, identifies similar functions, and proposes improvements.
- Behaviors: Scans the codebase or text, identifies redundancies, suggests refactoring, and tracks changes.
- Configuration: Requires access to the project's source code, content repositories, and coding standards.

### TesteurAgent
- Responsibilities: Creates and maintains tests, executes test suites, and identifies potential issues.
- Behaviors: Designs test cases, implements automated tests, runs test executions, and reports on test results.
- Configuration: Needs access to the project's testing frameworks, code repositories, and issue tracking systems.

### RedacteurAgent
- Responsibilities: Updates textual content, ensures style consistency, and maintains writing quality.
- Behaviors: Revises text, enforces style guidelines, provides feedback, and tracks content changes.
- Configuration: Requires access to the project's content, style guides, and communication channels.

## Agent Interactions
The KinOS agents collaborate in the following ways:

- The SpecificationsAgent works closely with the ProductionAgent to ensure that the generated content aligns with the defined requirements.
- The ManagementAgent coordinates the activities of the other agents, prioritizes tasks, and monitors the overall project progress.
- The EvaluationAgent provides feedback to the ProductionAgent and the ManagementAgent on the quality and performance of the produced content.
- The ChroniqueurAgent records the activities and changes made by the other agents, providing a comprehensive audit trail.
- The DocumentalisteAgent ensures that the content produced by the agents is properly documented and maintained.
- The DuplicationAgent works with the ProductionAgent and the RedacteurAgent to identify and reduce duplication in the project's content.
- The TesteurAgent collaborates with the ProductionAgent to create and execute tests, validating the correctness of the implemented features.
- The RedacteurAgent works with the ProductionAgent and the DocumentalisteAgent to ensure the textual content is of high quality and consistent with the project's style.

These interactions and dependencies between the agents are crucial for the successful and efficient completion of the project.
