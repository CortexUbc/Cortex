## Collaboration Protocols
1. **Dependencies**
   - **Required agent interactions**: Collaborate closely with character agents (Isabella Torres, Marcus Reynolds) and other management agents to align efforts.
   - **Input dependencies**: Rely on timely updates from agents regarding task progress and challenges encountered.
   - **Resource requirements**: Ensure adequate access to analytical tools and documentation for effective monitoring.
   - **Regular Check-ins**: Establish specific timelines for regular check-ins, such as weekly updates, to ensure all agents are aligned.
   - **Communication Guidelines**: Provide clear guidelines on the format and content of communication between agents to streamline information flow.
