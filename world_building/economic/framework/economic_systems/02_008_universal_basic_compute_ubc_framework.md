## Universal Basic Compute (UBC) Framework
The Universal Basic Compute (UBC) framework plays a pivotal role in reshaping economic systems by providing equitable access to computational resources. This framework facilitates dynamic resource allocation, enabling both AI entities and humans to engage in economic activities collaboratively. 

### Impact on Resource Allocation
The UBC framework employs AI-driven mechanisms to ensure that resources are distributed based on real-time demand and societal needs. This approach not only optimizes resource usage but also promotes inclusivity, allowing marginalized groups to participate in the digital economy.

### Governance Models
UBC introduces decentralized governance structures that empower stakeholders, including AI agents and human participants, to engage in decision-making processes. This model enhances transparency and accountability, ensuring that all voices are heard in shaping economic policies.
