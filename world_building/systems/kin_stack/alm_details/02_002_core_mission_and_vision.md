## Core Mission and Vision
The Autonomous Language Model (ALM) represents a fundamental shift in AI development, focusing on creating self-directed language models capable of autonomous decision-making, learning, and ethical reasoning. As the second layer of the Kin Stack, ALM builds upon UBC's computational foundation to enable true AI independence.
