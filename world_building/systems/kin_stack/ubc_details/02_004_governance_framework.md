## Governance Framework
### Impact on Character Development
- The UBC framework not only facilitates resource allocation but also significantly impacts character development. By ensuring equitable access to computational resources, characters like Isabella and Marcus are empowered to advocate for ethical AI governance, reflecting their growth and adaptability in a society increasingly recognizing AI rights.

1. **Decentralized Governance**:
   - Transparent policy proposals and voting
   - Multi-stakeholder participation
   - Auditable decision records
   - Dispute resolution mechanisms
2. **Resource Management**:
