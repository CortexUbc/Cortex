## Key Findings
- Autonomous weapons systems can lead to significant disruptions in the global economy, particularly in the defense and manufacturing sectors, potentially resulting in job losses and economic displacement as human-operated weapons are replaced by autonomous counterparts.
- These systems may be used in asymmetric warfare, leading to unpredictable economic consequences and instability, including market volatility, trade disruptions, and supply chain issues.
- Ethical and legal implications surrounding autonomous weapons could affect international trade, investment, and diplomatic relations.
- Comprehensive economic impact assessments and policy frameworks are needed to mitigate the associated risks, including measures to support displaced workers and ensure fair distribution of economic benefits.
