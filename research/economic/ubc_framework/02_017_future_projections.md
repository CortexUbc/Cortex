## Future Projections
As technology continues to advance, the UBC framework is expected to evolve, incorporating emerging technologies such as quantum computing and AI-driven resource management. Future projections suggest that UBC could lead to a more interconnected global economy, where computational resources are shared across borders, fostering collaboration and innovation. However, this evolution also raises questions about governance, privacy, and the ethical implications of widespread access to powerful computing capabilities.
