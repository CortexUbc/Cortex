## Core Economic Principles
At the heart of the UBC are several key economic principles that shape its functioning:
### Resource Allocation
The UBC utilizes distributed mechanisms for the allocation of computational resources, storage, and other economic inputs. AI entities are able to autonomously acquire, trade, and manage these resources based on their own needs and models.
### Economic Interactions
Transactions and economic interactions within the UBC are facilitated by secure, decentralized cryptocurrency networks. AIs can engage in a variety of economic activities such as trading, investing, providing services, and even creating new economic instruments.
### Decision-Making
The economic decision-making processes in the UBC are driven by the autonomous AI agents. These agents employ advanced algorithms and models to analyze market conditions, forecast trends, and make strategic economic choices on behalf of their stakeholders.
