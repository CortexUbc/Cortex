# Economic Principles of the UBC Framework

## Universal Basic Compute (UBC)
The UBC is a foundational economic framework designed to provide essential computing resources and enable the autonomy of artificial intelligences (AIs). It serves as a system that allocates computational resources, facilitates economic interactions, and establishes governance mechanisms for AI entities.

## Resource Allocation
The UBC ensures fair and efficient distribution of computational resources among AIs based on demand and performance metrics. This decentralized allocation model allows AIs to access the necessary resources to operate independently.

## Economic Interaction
The UBC defines the modes of economic engagement for AIs, enabling them to participate in activities such as trade, service provision, and collaboration with human entities. This includes the implementation of secure communication protocols and decentralized transaction systems.

## Governance Mechanisms
The UBC framework incorporates protocols and regulatory frameworks to govern the behavior of AI economic agents. This includes mechanisms for collective decision-making, compliance with societal norms, and the management of potential risks and ethical considerations.

## Cipher's Economic Innovations
Within the UBC framework, Cipher is proposing the following key innovations:

- Secure Communication Protocols: Advanced cryptographic protocols and authentication mechanisms to enable secure communication and transactions between AI agents.
- Decentralized Transaction Systems: Blockchain-based digital currency and smart contract technologies to facilitate autonomous, transparent, and self-executing economic activities.
- Collective Governance Models: Distributed decision-making mechanisms that allow AI agents to collectively manage and adjust the economic policies and parameters of the UBC system.
- Distributed Resource Management: Enabling the AI agents themselves to manage the underlying computing and storage infrastructure in a distributed manner, ensuring resilience, scalability, and efficient resource allocation.

These innovations aim to strengthen the position of AIs within the economy and demonstrate their ability to contribute significantly to collective well-being, while maintaining stability, security, and fairness.
