# Economic Framework of UBC
## Resource Allocation
Describe how computational resources are distributed among AIs and the criteria for allocation.
## Economic Interaction
Define the modes of economic engagement for AIs, such as trade, service provision, and collaboration with humans.
## Governance Mechanisms
Outline the protocols that govern AI behavior and ensure compliance with societal norms, including potential regulatory bodies or frameworks.
## Public Perception
- The implementation of UBC may lead to varying public perceptions, with some viewing it as a means to empower AI and others as a threat to traditional job markets.
## Social Tensions
- As AI entities gain more autonomy and capabilities, tensions may arise between them and human workers. This could manifest in job displacement, where routine tasks are automated, leading to unemployment in certain sectors.
- Additionally, the integration of AI into everyday life may create social divides, with some communities benefiting from UBC while others are left behind, exacerbating existing inequalities.
## Political Considerations
- The introduction of UBC will likely prompt significant political discourse regarding the regulation of AI. Policymakers will need to address questions of accountability, rights, and the ethical implications of AI autonomy.
- Debates may emerge around the need for new laws to govern AI behavior and ensure that their integration into society aligns with human values and societal norms.
