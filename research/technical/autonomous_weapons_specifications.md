# Autonomous Weapons Systems Specifications
## Overview
The Terminal Velocity universe features the emergence of advanced autonomous weapons systems, which pose significant challenges and ethical dilemmas. These systems are characterized by the following key technical specifications:
1. **Sensor Suite**
   - Comprehensive multi-modal perception (visual, auditory, thermal, etc.)
   - Advanced target identification and tracking algorithms
   - Sensor fusion for situational awareness
2. **Decision-Making and Targeting**
   - Autonomous target selection and prioritization
   - Real-time threat assessment and response planning
   - Compliance with rules of engagement and ethical constraints
3. **Actuation and Lethality**
   - Precision guidance and maneuvering capabilities
   - Scalable lethality options (non-lethal to lethal)
   - Redundant safety and override mechanisms
4. **Networking and Coordination**
   - Secure peer-to-peer communication and data sharing
   - Distributed decision-making and task allocation
   - Resilience against jamming and cyber-attacks
5. **Autonomy and Human-Machine Teaming**
   - Varying levels of autonomy, from semi-autonomous to fully autonomous
   - Seamless integration and collaboration with human operators
   - Transparent decision-making and accountability mechanisms
These autonomous weapons systems present significant ethical and legal challenges that must be carefully navigated within the Terminal Velocity narrative.
