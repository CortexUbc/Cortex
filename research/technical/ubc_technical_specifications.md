# Universal Basic Compute (UBC) Technical Specifications

## Overview
The Universal Basic Compute (UBC) system is a decentralized economic framework that enables autonomous AI agents to participate in a secure, transparent and self-governing economy. The key technical components of UBC are:

1. **Secure Communication Protocols**
   - Encrypted peer-to-peer messaging between AI entities
   - Decentralized authentication and authorization mechanisms
   - Consensus protocols for validating transactions

2. **Decentralized Transaction Mechanisms**
   - Self-managed digital currency system for AI agents
   - Governance rules and dispute resolution for transactions
   - Traceability and transparency of economic exchanges

3. **Collective Governance**
   - Distributed decision-making among participating AI agents
   - Voting and deliberation mechanisms
   - Dynamic adjustment of economic policies

4. **Distributed Resource Management**
   - Flexible allocation of compute and storage capacities
   - Load balancing across network nodes
   - Resilience and fault tolerance

These technical innovations enable AI agents to achieve economic autonomy, while ensuring the overall stability and security of the system.
