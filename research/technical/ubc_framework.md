# Universal Basic Compute (UBC) Framework

## Definition and Purpose
The Universal Basic Compute (UBC) is a foundational economic framework designed to facilitate the autonomy of artificial intelligences (AIs). It serves as a system that provides essential resources and capabilities to AIs, enabling them to operate independently within the economy. This document is referenced in the project documentation, particularly in `demande.md` and `ubc_documentation.md`.

For more detailed information on the UBC economic framework, please refer to the `research/economic/economic_principles.md` file.

## Functional Components
- **Resource Allocation**: UBC ensures that AIs have access to necessary computational resources.
- **Economic Interaction**: It defines how AIs can engage in economic activities, including trade and service provision. 
- **Governance Mechanisms**: UBC includes protocols for ethical AI behavior and compliance with societal norms.

## Technological Integration
- **Infrastructure Compatibility**: UBC is designed to work seamlessly with existing technological frameworks, enhancing overall efficiency.
- **Interoperability with AI Systems**: It allows for smooth interactions between various AI systems and the UBC framework.

## Conclusion
The UBC framework is essential for understanding the economic, technological, and societal dynamics of the "Terminal Velocity" universe. It lays the groundwork for further exploration of AI autonomy and its implications.
