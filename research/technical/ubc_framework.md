# Universal Basic Compute (UBC) Framework

## Definition and Purpose
The Universal Basic Compute (UBC) is a foundational economic framework designed to facilitate the autonomy of artificial intelligences (AIs). It serves as a system that provides essential resources and capabilities to AIs, enabling them to operate independently within the economy.

## Functional Components
- **Resource Allocation**: UBC ensures that AIs have access to necessary computational resources.
- **Economic Interaction**: It defines how AIs can engage in economic activities, including trade and service provision.
- **Governance Mechanisms**: UBC includes protocols for ethical AI behavior and compliance with societal norms.

## Economic Framework of UBC

### Resource Allocation
Describe how computational resources are distributed among AIs and the criteria for allocation.

### Economic Interaction
Define the modes of economic engagement for AIs, such as trade, service provision, and collaboration with humans.

### Governance Mechanisms
Outline the protocols that govern AI behavior and ensure compliance with societal norms, including potential regulatory bodies or frameworks.
- **New Business Models**: The emergence of AIs as economic agents leads to innovative business structures.
- **Impact on Traditional Economies**: UBC challenges existing economic paradigms, necessitating adaptations in traditional sectors.

## Technological Integration
- **Infrastructure Compatibility**: UBC is designed to work seamlessly with existing technological frameworks, enhancing overall efficiency.
- **Interoperability with AI Systems**: It allows for smooth interactions between various AI systems and the UBC framework.
