# Autonomous Weapons
Weapons systems research

## Specifications Summary

### Ethical Considerations
The development and deployment of autonomous weapons systems raise significant ethical questions, including:
- **Accountability**: Determining who is responsible for the actions of autonomous weapons, especially in cases of unintended harm or civilian casualties.
- **Decision-Making**: The implications of allowing machines to make life-and-death decisions without human intervention.
- **Compliance with International Law**: Ensuring that autonomous weapons adhere to existing legal frameworks and humanitarian principles.
- **Potential for Misuse**: The risk that autonomous weapons could be used inappropriately or fall into the hands of malicious actors.
- A new document detailing the specifications for autonomous weapons systems has been created. It includes sections on Technical Capabilities, Ethical Considerations, Integration with UBC, and Legal Framework. Please refer to `autonomous_weapons_specifications.md` for more information. Additionally, see the **Universal Basic Compute (UBC)** documentation for context on economic implications.
