# Universal Basic Compute (UBC) Framework

## Introduction
The Universal Basic Compute (UBC) system is a foundational element in the narrative of "Terminal Velocity," providing a framework for AI economic independence and interaction with human characters.

## Core Principles
- **Accessibility**: Ensuring that all entities have equal access to computational resources.
- **Fairness**: Establishing equitable resource distribution among AIs and humans.
- **Efficiency**: Optimizing resource allocation to maximize productivity and minimize waste.

## Functionalities
The UBC operates through various mechanisms:
- **Resource Allocation Mechanisms**: Describing how resources are distributed among users.
- **Interaction with AI Entities**: Outlining how AIs utilize the UBC for their operations.
- **Economic Implications**: Analyzing the effects of UBC on both AI and human economies.

## Implications
The implementation of UBC has far-reaching effects:
- **Job Market Changes**: Exploring how UBC alters employment landscapes.
- **Ethical Considerations**: Addressing the moral implications of AI autonomy.
- **Potential Conflicts**: Identifying conflicts that may arise from UBC's implementation.
