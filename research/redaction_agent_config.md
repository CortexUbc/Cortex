## Redaction Protocols for Economic Framework Compliance

### Economic Data Identification Patterns
- Identify terms related to economic frameworks, such as "UBC", "resource allocation", "decentralized transactions", "AI-generated content", and "user interactions with AI".
- Implement regex patterns to capture variations of these terms in different contexts.
- Ensure that all identified economic-sensitive information is processed according to the latest project demands and privacy regulations.

### Decision Framework Updates
- Include compliance checks for economic data in the redaction process, ensuring that sensitive economic terms, including new identifiers from the UBC framework, are flagged for review.
- Implement enhanced protocols to ensure that all identified economic-sensitive information is processed according to the latest project demands and privacy regulations.

### Testing and Validation
- Conduct test runs on sample documents containing economic data to verify the effectiveness of the updated protocols, aiming for a minimum accuracy of 95% in identifying sensitive economic terms during redaction processes.
- Aim for at least 95% accuracy in identifying sensitive economic terms during redaction processes.
