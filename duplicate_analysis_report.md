- Consolidate scene descriptions into unified files to enhance narrative flow.
- Combine world-building documents that cover similar themes to streamline content.
- Integrate research findings into a cohesive document to avoid redundancy.
- Review and merge development arcs for characters to ensure a singular, clear evolution narrative.
- Eliminate duplicate interaction scripts by creating a master script that encompasses all relevant interactions.

## Conclusion
This report serves as a foundation for the next steps in the deduplication process, ensuring a more coherent narrative structure moving forward.
