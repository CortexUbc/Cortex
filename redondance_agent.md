## Proposed Modifications Based on Communication Logs
1. **Action Statement**
   - Analyze communication logs from the `suivi.md` file to identify recent failure patterns in agent communications and propose modifications to improve redundancy strategies.

2. **Source Files**
   - Primary File: `suivi.md`
     - Relevant Sections: Focus on the logs of agent interactions and any reported communication failures.
   - Secondary Files: `redondance_agent.md`
     - Relevant Sections: Review the existing redundancy strategies and error handling protocols.

3. **Target Changes**
   - Modify `redondance_agent.md` to incorporate new redundancy strategies based on the identified failure patterns. 
   - Expected changes include updated protocols for monitoring failures and enhanced error handling methods to improve system robustness.

4. **Validation Points**
   - Verify success by checking for the inclusion of new strategies in the `redondance_agent.md` file.
   - Output to check: Ensure that the new protocols reflect the recent failure patterns documented in `suivi.md`.
   - Validate that redundancy success rate targets are adjusted accordingly based on the proposed changes.

5. **Operation Bounds**
   - Resource Limitations: Ensure not to exceed the existing memory and processing limits of the KinOS system when implementing changes.
   - Scope Restrictions: Focus solely on redundancy improvements; do not address unrelated error management issues.
   - Dependency Requirements: Ensure access to both `suivi.md` and `redondance_agent.md` for comprehensive analysis and updates.

6. **Search**
   - Search: "communication failure" in `suivi.md` to gather insights on recent issues affecting agent interactions.
