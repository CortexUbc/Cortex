## Identified Gaps in Interaction Scripts
- **Lack of Emotional Depth**: Current interactions do not fully explore the emotional stakes involved in Isabella's interactions with Marcus. For example, during a pivotal moment, Isabella could express her fears about the implications of Marcus's policies on vulnerable populations.
- **Missed Opportunities for Conflict Resolution**: There are instances where conflicts arise, but the scripts do not explore potential resolutions or compromises, which could add complexity to the characters' relationships. For instance, a scene could be added where Marcus acknowledges Isabella's concerns, creating a moment of vulnerability that deepens their relationship.
- **Underdeveloped Collaborative Moments**: While there are collaborative scenes, they often lack detail on how the characters negotiate their differences, which is crucial for character development. Expanding on these moments can illustrate their ability to work together despite ideological differences.
- **Example of Emotional Stakes**: In a key interaction, Isabella might say, "If we prioritize economic efficiency over social justice, we risk leaving vulnerable communities behind." This highlights her internal conflict and the emotional stakes involved in their discussions.
