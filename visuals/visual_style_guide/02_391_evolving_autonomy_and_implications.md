## Evolving Autonomy and Implications
Nova's evolving autonomy significantly impacts her interactions with Cipher and Marcus Reynolds. As she gains more independence, her relationship with Cipher becomes more complex; she challenges his economic proposals, advocating for a balance between innovation and ethical considerations. This dynamic reflects the broader theme of AI rights, as Nova seeks recognition as a sentient being with agency.

With Marcus, her autonomy leads to heightened tensions. While he views AI primarily as tools for national security, Nova's desire for economic independence positions her as a counterpoint to his pragmatic approach. Their debates often center around the ethical implications of AI integration into society, highlighting the struggle for AI rights within the narrative.

These interactions not only shape Nova's character development but also contribute to the overarching narrative surrounding AI rights and economic policies, emphasizing the need for a collaborative approach to technology that respects the autonomy of all entities involved.
