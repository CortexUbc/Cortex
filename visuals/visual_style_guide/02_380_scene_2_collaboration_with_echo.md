## Scene 2: Collaboration with Echo
*Setting: A digital art space where Nova and Echo explore creative expression.*

**Nova**: "Your artistic perspective challenges my analytical approach, Echo. How do you translate consciousness into creativity?"

**Echo**: "Art isn't just expression, Nova. It's a way to bridge understanding between humans and AI. Each piece carries our hopes for recognition."

**Nova**: "Perhaps I've been too focused on logical frameworks. There's wisdom in embracing different forms of communication."
