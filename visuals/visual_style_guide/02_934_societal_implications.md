## Societal Implications
The transition to a UBC-based economy carries both opportunities and challenges for society, including:

1. **Income Inequality**: The UBC framework aims to reduce wealth disparities by ensuring more equitable access to economic resources, but may also disrupt existing socioeconomic structures.

2. **Technological Resistance**: The radical shift in economic paradigms may face resistance from those who benefit from the current system, requiring careful management of the transition process.

3. **Systemic Resilience**: The decentralized and autonomous nature of UBC may enhance the overall resilience of the economic system, but also introduces new risks that must be carefully monitored and addressed.
