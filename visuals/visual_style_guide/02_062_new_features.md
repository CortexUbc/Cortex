## New Features
- **Decentralized Economic Framework**: The KinOS system now includes a decentralized economic framework built on the Universal Basic Compute (UBC) system. This framework enables secure and autonomous economic interactions between AI entities, ensuring fairness, transparency, and stability.
- **Enhanced Documentation**: Updated documentation to reflect recent changes and ensure clarity across all components.
  - Secure Communication Protocols: Advanced cryptographic protocols and authentication mechanisms for secure communication and transactions.
  - Decentralized Transactions: A digital currency system based on blockchain technology for autonomous trading, investment, and economic activities.
  - Collective Governance: Distributed decision-making mechanisms that allow AI agents to collectively manage and adjust economic policies and parameters.
  - Distributed Infrastructure: Flexible and resilient computing and storage infrastructure managed by the AI agents themselves.

- **Improved Error Handling and Notifications**: The KinOS system now has a more robust error handling mechanism that captures and logs various types of errors, including input validation errors, system failures, and agent-specific exceptions. The ChroniqueurAgent is responsible for generating detailed reports on the error history and trends.

- **Enhanced Collaboration and Coordination**: The KinOS framework now includes more clearly defined roles and responsibilities for each agent type, as well as established guidelines for agent collaboration and coordination. This helps maintain visibility and alignment across the project.
