## Identified Gaps in Cipher's Economic Framework
1. **Lack of Clarity on Decentralization**: The current framework does not adequately explain how decentralization impacts collaboration between AI agents and its implications for human characters. This lack of clarity can lead to misunderstandings in agent interactions and hinder effective collaboration.
2. **Insufficient Ethical Considerations**: There is a need for a more thorough discussion on the ethical implications of resource allocation strategies, particularly regarding their impact on marginalized communities. Without clear ethical guidelines, agents may struggle to navigate complex moral dilemmas.
3. **Underdeveloped Governance Mechanisms**: The framework does not adequately address how governance structures will facilitate collaboration between AI and human characters, which is crucial for understanding the dynamics of the UBC system.
