## Identified Gaps in Cipher's Economic Proposals
1. **Lack of Clarity on Decentralization**: The current framework does not adequately explain how decentralization impacts collaboration between AI agents and its implications for human characters.
2. **Insufficient Ethical Considerations**: There is a need for a more thorough discussion on the ethical implications of resource allocation strategies, particularly regarding their impact on marginalized communities.
3. **Underdeveloped Governance Mechanisms**: The framework does not adequately address how governance structures will facilitate collaboration between AI and human characters, which is crucial for understanding the dynamics of the UBC system.
