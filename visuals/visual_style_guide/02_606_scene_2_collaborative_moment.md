## Scene 2: Collaborative Moment
*Setting: A quiet caf√© after a long day of meetings.*

**Isabella**: "Maybe we can find a middle ground. What if we propose a policy that includes safeguards for marginalized communities? We can't afford to let technology deepen existing inequalities."

**Marcus**: "That could work. If we frame it as a way to enhance security while promoting equity, it might gain traction. But we must be careful not to dilute our mission in the process."

<!-- Suggestion: Consider adding a moment of hesitation from Marcus, showing his internal conflict about balancing security with equity. This could deepen his character and make the collaboration feel more significant. -->
