## Identified Gaps in Cipher's Economic Framework
1. **Lack of Clarity on Societal Implications**: The current framework does not adequately address how the proposed economic models will impact human communities, particularly marginalized groups. This gap can lead to misunderstandings about the role of AI in society and its ethical implications.
2. **Insufficient Ethical Governance Mechanisms**: While the framework mentions governance, it lacks detailed descriptions of how ethical standards will be enforced and how AI entities will be held accountable for their actions.
3. **Need for Practical Examples**: The framework would benefit from case studies or scenarios that illustrate the successful implementation of these economic principles in real-world contexts, demonstrating their societal impact.
