## Scene 3: Climactic Confrontation
*Setting: A public forum where both are presenting their views.*

**Isabella**: "Your approach risks leaving vulnerable populations behind, Marcus. We need to ensure that technology serves everyone, not just the privileged. If we don't address these issues now, we may face a backlash that could undermine our progress."

**Marcus**: "And we need to protect our nation first. If we don't act decisively, we risk everything we've built. But I see your point; we must find a way to include those voices."

<!-- Suggestion: This moment could be heightened by Isabella expressing a personal stake in the issue, perhaps referencing a community she represents. This would add emotional weight to her argument and challenge Marcus to reconsider his stance. -->

*Both characters reflect on their motivations, realizing that their goals, while different, stem from a shared desire to create a better future.*
