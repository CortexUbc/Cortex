## Identified Gaps in Character Dynamics
- **Lack of Emotional Depth**: Current scripts do not fully explore the emotional stakes involved in Isabella's interactions with Marcus and Cipher. Enhancing these moments can create a more engaging narrative.
- **Missed Opportunities for Conflict Resolution**: There are instances where conflicts arise, but the scripts do not explore potential resolutions or compromises, which could add complexity to the characters' relationships.
- **Underdeveloped Collaborative Moments**: While there are collaborative scenes, they often lack detail on how the characters negotiate their differences, which is crucial for character development.
