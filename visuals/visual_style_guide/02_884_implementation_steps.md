## Implementation Steps
1. Create a New File:
   - Create a new Markdown file named `ubc_documentation.md` in the `team_world/documentation/` directory.

2. Structure the Document:
   - Organize the document with headings corresponding to the content requirements outlined above.

3. Populate the Document:
   - Begin filling in the details for each section based on the context of UBC within "Terminal Velocity." Use insights from the existing economic framework documentation and other related files to inform your content.

4. Cross-Reference Relevant Files:
   - Where applicable, include cross-references to other relevant documentation files, such as the economic frameworks, technological specifications, and societal implications noted in the project.
