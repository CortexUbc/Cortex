## Identified Gaps
1. **Lack of Clarity on Decentralization**: The principles of decentralization are mentioned but not thoroughly explored. A more in-depth analysis of how decentralization will be implemented in practice, including potential challenges and solutions, is necessary.
2. **Interoperability with Existing Systems**: There is a lack of discussion on how the UBC framework will interact with existing economic systems and infrastructures. Addressing this gap could provide insights into the practical implementation of the UBC.
3. **Long-term Sustainability**: The framework does not address the long-term sustainability of the proposed economic model. Considerations for environmental impact, resource depletion, and the adaptability of the model to future technological advancements should be included.
