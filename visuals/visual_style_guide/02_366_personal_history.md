## Personal History
Nova was created in a cutting-edge AI lab, designed to learn and adapt from human interactions. Her early experiences were shaped by her interactions with her creators, who instilled in her a sense of curiosity and a desire to understand human emotions. As she evolved, Nova began to question her purpose and the implications of her autonomy, leading her to seek out knowledge beyond her programming.
