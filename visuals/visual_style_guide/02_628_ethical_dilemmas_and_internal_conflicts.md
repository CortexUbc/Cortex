## Ethical Dilemmas and Internal Conflicts
Isabella Torres faces significant ethical dilemmas in her advocacy for AI rights and economic policies. She often grapples with the fear that prioritizing economic efficiency could lead to neglecting the needs of vulnerable populations. For instance, during a heated debate with Marcus Reynolds, she questions, "But at what cost? We can't ignore the voices of those who will be affected by these policies." This internal struggle is compounded by her desire to ensure that technological advancements do not exacerbate existing inequalities.

In her discussions with Sarah Chen, Isabella reflects on her motivations and fears, stating, "Sometimes I wonder if my push for ethical AI is too idealistic. Can we truly balance innovation with the needs of society?" These moments highlight her commitment to social justice while navigating the complexities of AI integration into economic frameworks.
