### Identified Gaps in Interaction Dynamics
1. **Lack of Emotional Depth**: Current interactions do not fully explore the emotional stakes involved in Cipher's relationships with Isabella and Marcus. Enhancing these moments can create a more engaging narrative. For example, during a pivotal moment, Cipher could express his concerns about the implications of their policies on vulnerable populations.
2. **Missed Opportunities for Conflict Resolution**: There are instances where conflicts arise, but the scripts do not explore potential resolutions or compromises, which could add complexity to the characters' relationships. For instance, a scene could be added where Marcus acknowledges Isabella's concerns, creating a moment of vulnerability that deepens their relationship.
3. **Underdeveloped Collaborative Moments**: While there are collaborative scenes, they often lack detail on how the characters negotiate their differences, which is crucial for character development. Expanding on these moments can illustrate their ability to work together despite ideological differences.
