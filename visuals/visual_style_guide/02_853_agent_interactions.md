## Agent Interactions
The KinOS agents collaborate in the following ways:

- The SpecificationsAgent works closely with the ProductionAgent to ensure that the generated content aligns with the defined requirements.
- The ManagementAgent coordinates the activities of the other agents, prioritizes tasks, and monitors the overall project progress.
- The EvaluationAgent provides feedback to the ProductionAgent and the ManagementAgent on the quality and performance of the produced content.
- The ChroniqueurAgent records the activities and changes made by the other agents, providing a comprehensive audit trail.
- The DocumentalisteAgent ensures that the content produced by the agents is properly documented and maintained.
- The DuplicationAgent works with the ProductionAgent and the RedacteurAgent to identify and reduce duplication in the project's content.
- The TesteurAgent collaborates with the ProductionAgent to create and execute tests, validating the correctness of the implemented features.
- The RedacteurAgent works with the ProductionAgent and the DocumentalisteAgent to ensure the textual content is of high quality and consistent with the project's style.

These interactions and dependencies between the agents are crucial for the successful and efficient completion of the project.
