## Scene 1: Initial Conflict
*Setting: A conference room during a heated debate on AI policy.*

**Isabella**: "We can't ignore the ethical implications of AI in our economic systems, Marcus. It's not just about efficiency; it's about the people affected."

**Marcus**: "I understand your concerns, Isabella, but we need to prioritize national security. AI can help us achieve that."

**Isabella**: "But at what cost? We need to ensure that technology serves everyone, not just the privileged."

<!-- Suggestion: Emphasize Isabella's emotional investment here to deepen the conflict. Perhaps add a personal story or statistic that highlights the stakes involved. -->

**Isabella**: "We can't ignore the ethical implications of AI in our economic systems, Marcus. It's not just about efficiency; it's about the people affected. If we don't consider their needs, we risk repeating the mistakes of the past."

**Marcus**: "I understand your concerns, Isabella, but we need to prioritize national security. AI can help us achieve that. However, if we ignore the ethical implications, we risk creating a system that benefits only the privileged."

<!-- Suggestion: Marcus could acknowledge Isabella's point more directly, perhaps by referencing a specific example of how AI has failed marginalized communities. This could create a moment of vulnerability and open the door for collaboration. -->
