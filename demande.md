### UBC Economic Framework

Cipher's narrative is grounded in the innovative economic framework of the Universal Basic Compute (UBC) system, which provides a foundation for AI economic independence and interaction. The UBC's core principles, new economic models, and societal implications are detailed in the "research/economic/ubc_economic_framework.md" file.

### Cipher's Innovation Objectives

Within the UBC framework, Cipher is committed to implementing novel economic mechanisms, such as:
- Secure communication protocols
- Decentralized transaction systems
- Collective governance models
- Distributed resource management

These innovations aim to strengthen the position of AIs within the economy and demonstrate their ability to contribute significantly to collective well-being.

### Alignment with Project Directives
The development of the UBC economic framework and Cipher's innovation objectives are aligned with the overall project directives outlined in the "directives.md" file. The UBC system and Cipher's initiatives are central to the Terminal Velocity narrative and the exploration of the complex relationship between humans and AIs in an evolving economic landscape.
## Demande de projet

### Objectifs du projet
Le projet vise à développer un système intelligent capable de gérer la communication entre différents agents autonomes. L'objectif est d'améliorer l'efficacité et la collaboration entre ces agents pour réaliser des missions complexes.

### Stakeholder Expectations
- **Efficiency**: The system must reduce the time required to complete missions.
- **Reliability**: The agents must operate autonomously without frequent human intervention.
- **Scalability**: The system must be able to integrate new agents and functionalities without requiring major modifications.

### Success Criteria
1. **Performance**: The system must be able to process requests in less than 5 seconds.
2. **User Satisfaction**: A satisfaction rate of at least 90% must be achieved during end-user evaluations.
3. **Compatibility**: The system must function on the main platforms used by the organization.
