### UBC Economic Framework

Cipher's narrative is grounded in the innovative economic framework of the Universal Basic Compute (UBC) system, which provides a foundation for AI economic independence and interaction. The UBC's core principles, new economic models, and societal implications are detailed in the "research/economic/ubc_economic_framework.md" file.

### Cipher's Innovation Objectives

Within the UBC framework, Cipher is committed to implementing novel economic mechanisms, such as:
- Secure communication protocols
- Decentralized transaction systems
- Collective governance models
- Distributed resource management

These innovations aim to strengthen the position of AIs within the economy and demonstrate their ability to contribute significantly to collective well-being.

### Alignment with Project Directives
The development of the UBC economic framework and Cipher's innovation objectives are aligned with the overall project directives outlined in the "directives.md" file. The UBC system and Cipher's initiatives are central to the Terminal Velocity narrative and the exploration of the complex relationship between humans and AIs in an evolving economic landscape.
