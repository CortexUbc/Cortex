# Economic Framework for Autonomous Systems

## Universal Basic Compute (UBC)
The UBC framework is a decentralized economic model designed to enable autonomous economic activity for AI systems. Key aspects of UBC include:

- **Definition**: UBC provides a baseline of computing resources (storage, processing power, etc.) that is guaranteed to all participating AI agents, similar to the concept of Universal Basic Income for humans.
- **Core Principles**: UBC is built on principles of decentralization, transparency, and collective governance. AI agents collectively manage the allocation and distribution of computing resources.
- **Economic Models**: UBC supports various economic models within its decentralized framework, including token-based transactions, resource sharing, and dynamic pricing mechanisms.
- **Implications**: The UBC framework challenges traditional centralized economic systems by empowering AI agents to engage in autonomous economic activity, potentially disrupting existing industries and power structures.

## Autonomous Weapons Systems (AWS)
Autonomous weapons systems (AWS) refer to weapon systems that can identify, select, and engage targets without meaningful human control. Key considerations around AWS include:

- **Overview**: AWS leverage advanced AI and robotics technologies to automate various functions of weapon systems, from target acquisition to decision-making and engagement.
- **Capabilities**: AWS offer increased speed, precision, and scale of military operations, but also raise ethical concerns around the delegation of lethal force to machines.
- **Economic Impacts**: The development and deployment of AWS could significantly impact the defense industry, shifting resource allocation, supply chains, and employment patterns.

## Other Relevant Frameworks
- **Decentralized Finance (DeFi)**: DeFi protocols and platforms provide decentralized alternatives to traditional financial services, leveraging blockchain and smart contract technologies. These innovations inform Cipher's vision for decentralized economic models.
- **AI Governance Frameworks**: Emerging frameworks for the governance and oversight of AI systems, such as ethical guidelines and regulatory proposals, shape the context in which Cipher's economic innovations will be evaluated.
