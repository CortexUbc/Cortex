## Objective

To identify and redact sensitive information from specified files within the KinOS project, ensuring compliance with privacy and security standards regarding economic frameworks and character interactions.

## Step-by-Step Plan

### 1. File Monitoring Setup

- **Initiate monitoring on target files:** 

  - `demande/`

  - `demande_redacted.md`

  - `research/redaction_agent_config.md`

  - `research/redaction_report.md`

  - `characters/human_characters/isabella_torres/interaction_scripts/`

  - `characters/human_characters/isabella_torres/character_profiles/`

### 2. Detect Sensitive Information

- **Implement detection algorithms** to identify sensitive economic data and personally identifiable information (PII).

- **Monitor for specific keywords** or patterns related to the Universal Basic Compute (UBC) system and character financial details.

### 3. Execute Redaction Protocols

- **Upon detection of sensitive information:**

  - Initiate redaction protocols.

  - Replace sensitive data with placeholders or anonymized data while maintaining document integrity.

### 4. Validate Redaction

- **Conduct thorough validation** to confirm:

  - All instances of sensitive information are redacted without omissions.

  - The readability and logical flow of the document are preserved.

### 5. Compliance Checks

- **Cross-reference redacted content** with `research/redaction_agent_config.md` to ensure compliance with privacy regulations and internal security guidelines.

### 6. Document Integrity Assurance

- **Ensure that redacted documents** remain coherent and understandable.

- **Verify no unintended modifications** to unrelated sections of the document.

### 7. Optimization Strategies

- **Implement batch processing** for redaction tasks to enhance efficiency.

- **Optimize file monitoring intervals** to balance performance and responsiveness.

### 8. Duplication Management

- **Utilize duplication detection mechanisms** to prevent redundant redaction efforts.

- **Ensure consistency across related documents** during redaction operations.

### 9. Final Review and Reporting

- **Compile a report** detailing the redaction process, including:

  - Success indicators related to redaction completeness and document integrity.

  - Compliance assurance findings.

### 10. Continuous Improvement

- **Analyze the effectiveness** of the redaction process and make adjustments based on findings to improve future operations.

By following this structured plan, the Redaction Agent will operate effectively within the KinOS framework, ensuring sensitive information is properly handled and compliance is maintained.
