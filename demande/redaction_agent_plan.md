# Updated Redaction Agent Plan

## Objective
To identify and redact sensitive information from specified files within the KinOS project, ensuring compliance with privacy and security standards, particularly concerning economic frameworks and character interactions, while maintaining narrative coherence and alignment with the overarching goals of the "Terminal Velocity" project.

## Step 1: Initial Setup
- Ensure all monitoring directives are in place for the target files.
- Confirm that the Aider tool is operational and configured according to `research/redaction_agent_config.md`.

## Step 2: File Monitoring
- Begin monitoring the specified files for any changes, particularly focusing on:
  - `demande/`
  - `demande_redacted.md`
  - `research/redaction_agent_config.md`
  - `research/redaction_report.md`
  - `characters/human_characters/isabella_torres/interaction_scripts/`
  - `characters/human_characters/isabella_torres/character_profiles/`

## Step 3: Detect and Identify Sensitive Information
- Analyze the content for any sensitive economic data or personally identifiable information (PII).
- Pay particular attention to keywords or patterns related to the Universal Basic Compute (UBC) system or character financial details.

## Step 4: Redaction Protocols
- Upon detection of sensitive information:
  - Initiate redaction protocols using Aider.
  - Replace sensitive sections with placeholders or anonymized data while ensuring document coherence.

## Step 5: Validation of Redactions
- After redaction, confirm that:
  - All instances of sensitive information are successfully redacted.
  - The readability and logical flow of the document are maintained.
- Cross-reference redacted content with `research/redaction_agent_config.md` to ensure compliance.

## Step 6: Compliance Assurance
- Conduct compliance checks to ensure that redacted files adhere to privacy regulations and internal security guidelines.
- Validate that redacted content aligns with the compliance frameworks outlined in `research/redaction_agent_config.md`.

## Step 7: Reporting
- Document the redaction process and outcomes in `research/redaction_report.md`.
- Highlight any challenges faced during the redaction process and how they were addressed.

## Step 8: Optimization and Efficiency Review
- Review the efficiency of the redaction process and file monitoring intervals.
- Implement batch processing for future redaction tasks to enhance performance.

## Step 9: Continuous Monitoring
- Maintain ongoing monitoring of the target files to catch any new sensitive information that may arise in future updates.

By following this plan, the Redaction Agent will effectively identify and redact sensitive information while ensuring compliance and maintaining document integrity.
