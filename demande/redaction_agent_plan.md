## Mission Objectives

### 1. Set Up File Monitoring

- **Initiate monitoring for the following target files:** 

  - `demande/`

  - `demande_redacted.md`

  - `research/redaction_agent_config.md`

  - `research/redaction_report.md`

  - `characters/human_characters/isabella_torres/interaction_scripts/`

  - `characters/human_characters/isabella_torres/character_profiles/`

3. Maintain document integrity and coherence post-redaction.

- **Implement algorithms** to identify sensitive economic data and personally identifiable information (PII).

- **Monitor for specific keywords** or patterns related to the Universal Basic Compute (UBC) system and character financial details.

- Monitor the following files and directories for sensitive information:

- **Upon detecting sensitive information:**

  - Initiate redaction protocols.

  - Replace sensitive data with placeholders or anonymized data while maintaining document integrity.

  - `demande_redacted.md`

- **Conduct validation** to confirm:

  - All instances of sensitive information are redacted without omissions.

  - The readability and logical flow of the document are preserved.

### 5. Conduct Compliance Checks

- **Cross-reference redacted content** with `research/redaction_agent_config.md` to ensure compliance with privacy regulations.

### 6. Ensure Document Integrity

- **Ensure redacted documents** remain coherent and understandable.

- **Verify no unintended modifications** to unrelated sections of the document.

### 7. Implement Optimization Strategies

- **Implement batch processing** for redaction tasks to improve efficiency.

- **Optimize file monitoring intervals** to balance performance and responsiveness.

### 8. Manage Duplications

- **Utilize detection mechanisms** to prevent redundant redaction efforts.

- **Ensure consistency across related documents** during redaction operations.

### 9. Conduct Final Review and Reporting

- **Compile a report** detailing the redaction process, including:

  - Success indicators related to redaction completeness and document integrity.

  - Compliance assurance findings.

### 10. Implement Continuous Improvement

- **Analyze the effectiveness** of the redaction process and adjust based on findings to improve future operations.

  - Specific keywords or patterns related to the Universal Basic Compute (UBC) system or character financial details.
