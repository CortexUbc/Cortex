## Objective

Identify and redact sensitive information from specified files in the KinOS project to ensure compliance with privacy and security standards.

## Step-by-Step Plan

### 1. Set Up File Monitoring

- **Initiate monitoring for the following target files:** 

  - `demande/`

  - `demande_redacted.md`

  - `research/redaction_agent_config.md`

  - `research/redaction_report.md`

  - `characters/human_characters/isabella_torres/interaction_scripts/`

  - `characters/human_characters/isabella_torres/character_profiles/`

### 2. Detect Sensitive Information

- **Implement algorithms** to identify sensitive economic data and personally identifiable information (PII).

- **Monitor for specific keywords** or patterns related to the Universal Basic Compute (UBC) system and character financial details.

### 3. Execute Redaction Protocols

- **Upon detecting sensitive information:**

  - Initiate redaction protocols.

  - Replace sensitive data with placeholders or anonymized data while maintaining document integrity.

### 4. Validate Redaction

- **Conduct validation** to confirm:

  - All instances of sensitive information are redacted without omissions.

  - The readability and logical flow of the document are preserved.

### 5. Conduct Compliance Checks

- **Cross-reference redacted content** with `research/redaction_agent_config.md` to ensure compliance with privacy regulations.

### 6. Ensure Document Integrity

- **Ensure redacted documents** remain coherent and understandable.

- **Verify no unintended modifications** to unrelated sections of the document.

### 7. Implement Optimization Strategies

- **Implement batch processing** for redaction tasks to improve efficiency.

- **Optimize file monitoring intervals** to balance performance and responsiveness.

### 8. Manage Duplications

- **Utilize detection mechanisms** to prevent redundant redaction efforts.

- **Ensure consistency across related documents** during redaction operations.

### 9. Conduct Final Review and Reporting

- **Compile a report** detailing the redaction process, including:

  - Success indicators related to redaction completeness and document integrity.

  - Compliance assurance findings.

### 10. Implement Continuous Improvement

- **Analyze the effectiveness** of the redaction process and adjust based on findings to improve future operations.

By following this structured plan, the Redaction Agent will operate effectively within the KinOS framework, ensuring sensitive information is properly handled and compliance is maintained.
