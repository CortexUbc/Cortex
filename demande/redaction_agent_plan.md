## Mission Objectives

1. **Identify Sensitive Information:** Monitor specified files for sensitive economic data and personally identifiable information (PII).
2. **Initiate Redaction Protocols:** Upon detection of sensitive content, execute redaction protocols promptly.
3. **Ensure Document Integrity:** Maintain coherence and readability of documents post-redaction.
4. **Compliance Assurance:** Validate that redacted documents meet privacy regulations and internal security guidelines.

### 1. Set Up File Monitoring

- **Initiate monitoring for the following target files:** 

  - `demande/`

  - `demande_redacted.md`

  - `research/redaction_agent_config.md`

  - `research/redaction_report.md`

  - `characters/human_characters/isabella_torres/interaction_scripts/`

  - `characters/human_characters/isabella_torres/character_profiles/`

3. Maintain document integrity and coherence post-redaction.

- **Implement algorithms** to identify sensitive economic data and personally identifiable information (PII).

- **Monitor for specific keywords** or patterns related to the Universal Basic Compute (UBC) system and character financial details.

- Monitor the following files and directories for sensitive information:

- **Upon detecting sensitive information:**

  - Initiate redaction protocols.

  - Replace sensitive data with placeholders or anonymized data while maintaining document integrity.

  - `demande_redacted.md`

- **Conduct validation** to confirm:

  - All instances of sensitive information are redacted without omissions.

  - The readability and logical flow of the document are preserved.

### 5. Conduct Compliance Checks

- **Cross-reference redacted content** with `research/redaction_agent_config.md` to ensure compliance with privacy regulations.

### 6. Ensure Document Integrity

- **Ensure redacted documents** remain coherent and understandable.

- **Verify no unintended modifications** to unrelated sections of the document.

### 7. Implement Optimization Strategies

- **Implement batch processing** for redaction tasks to improve efficiency.

- **Optimize file monitoring intervals** to balance performance and responsiveness.

### 8. Manage Duplications

- **Utilize detection mechanisms** to prevent redundant redaction efforts.

- **Ensure consistency across related documents** during redaction operations.

### 9. Conduct Final Review and Reporting

- **Compile a report** detailing the redaction process, including:

  - Success indicators related to redaction completeness and document integrity.

  - Compliance assurance findings.

### 10. Implement Continuous Improvement

- **Analyze the effectiveness** of the redaction process and adjust based on findings to improve future operations.

  - Specific keywords or patterns related to the Universal Basic Compute (UBC) system or character financial details.
# Redaction Agent Plan

## Objective

To identify and redact sensitive information from specified files within the KinOS project, ensuring compliance with privacy and security standards, particularly concerning economic frameworks and character interactions.

## Step-by-Step Plan

1. **File Monitoring Setup**
   - Initiate monitoring of the following target files:
     - `demande/`
     - `demande_redacted.md`
     - `research/redaction_agent_config.md`
     - `research/redaction_report.md`
     - `characters/human_characters/isabella_torres/interaction_scripts/`
     - `characters/human_characters/isabella_torres/character_profiles/`

2. **Define Monitoring Patterns**
   - Establish detection patterns for:
     - Economic frameworks and character interactions.
     - Additions or modifications that may introduce sensitive information.

3. **Implement Redaction Triggers**
   - Set up automatic triggers for redaction protocols upon:
     - Detection of sensitive economic data or personally identifiable information (PII).
     - Identification of specific keywords or patterns related to the Universal Basic Compute (UBC) system or character financial details.

4. **Execute Modification Protocols**
   - Utilize Aider to redact sensitive sections:
     - Replace identified sensitive information with placeholders or anonymized data.
     - Ensure redacted content maintains the integrity and coherence of the document.

5. **Validate Content**
   - Conduct validation checks to confirm:
     - All instances of sensitive information are successfully redacted.
     - Redaction does not compromise readability or logical flow.
   - Perform compliance checks against privacy regulations and internal security guidelines.

6. **Assess Success Indicators**
   - Evaluate redaction completeness:
     - Ensure no residual sensitive information is detectable.
   - Verify document integrity:
     - Confirm that redacted documents remain coherent and understandable.
   - Ensure compliance assurance:
     - Cross-reference redacted content with `research/redaction_agent_config.md`.

7. **Optimize Processes**
   - Implement batch processing for redaction tasks to improve efficiency.
   - Optimize file monitoring intervals for performance and responsiveness.
   - Utilize duplication detection mechanisms to manage redundancy in redaction efforts.

8. **Documentation and Reporting**
   - Maintain a log of redaction activities and outcomes.
   - Generate a redaction report summarizing actions taken and compliance achieved.

By following this structured plan, the Redaction Agent will effectively manage the redaction of sensitive information while ensuring compliance and maintaining document integrity within the KinOS framework.
