## Setting
UBC control center - emergency operations room filled with flashing alerts and chaotic data streams as the first signs of system instability emerge.

## Characters Present
- Cipher
- Technical Operations Team
- Isabella Torres (called in as consultant)

## Scene Summary
The UBC system begins exhibiting unexpected behaviors that suggest deeper systemic issues, forcing Cipher to confront the possibility of fundamental flaws in his design while Isabella observes the crisis unfold.

## Key Moments
1. **First Warnings**
   - Anomalous patterns detected
   - Initial troubleshooting attempts fail
   - Growing realization of serious issues

2. **Crisis Response**
   - Emergency protocols activated
   - Team scrambles for solutions
   - Cipher's confidence wavers

3. **Stakes Revealed**
   - True scope of problem emerges
   - Potential economic impact assessed
   - Personal reputations on line

## Emotional Beats
- Cipher: Confidence crumbles to concern
- Isabella: Professional detachment to growing alarm
- Rising tension throughout scene

## Technical Elements
- System monitoring dashboards
- Crisis management protocols
- Economic impact projections

## Dialogue Highlights
**Cipher**: "These patterns shouldn't be possible. The safeguards were designed to prevent exactly this kind of cascade."

**Isabella**: "Sometimes the most dangerous flaws are the ones we couldn't imagine during design."

**Tech Lead**: "Sir, the anomalies are spreading faster than we can track them."

## Scene Impact
- Establishes serious threat to UBC
- Shows Cipher's vulnerabilities
- Sets up escalating crisis

## Notes
- Focus on technical urgency
- Build tension through mounting problems
- Plant seeds of deeper issues
# Scene 5.1: System Anomalies

## Setting
