# Scene 2.1: Cipher's Vision
## Setting
Virtual conference room with advanced holographic displays showing economic models and projections. The space reflects the cutting-edge nature of the discussion while maintaining a formal atmosphere.
## Characters Present
- Cipher
- Nova
- Isabella Torres (observing)
## Scene Summary
Cipher presents his revolutionary vision for AI autonomy and economic transformation through the UBC framework.

Isabella observes quietly, noting both the brilliance and potential risks in his proposals.
## Key Moments
1. **Cipher's Presentation**
   - Detailed explanation of decentralized economic model
   - Emphasis on AI autonomy and innovation
   - Passionate defense of rapid transformation
2. **Nova's Counterpoints**

- Isabella: Growing awareness of the stakes involved
## Technical Elements
- Advanced economic modeling systems
- Real-time projection capabilities
- Data visualization interfaces
## Dialogue Highlights
**Cipher**: "Our current economic systems are fundamentally limited. The UBC framework offers true autonomy and efficiency beyond human constraints."
**Nova**: "And what of the risks? Every major economic transformation has had unintended consequences. We cannot simply discard centuries of established practice."
**Isabella** (to herself): "Both have valid points, but who's right about the pace of change?"
