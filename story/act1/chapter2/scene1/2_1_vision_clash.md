# Scene 2.1: Vision Clash

## Setting
Virtual conference room with advanced holographic displays showing economic models and projections. The space reflects the cutting-edge nature of the discussion while maintaining a formal atmosphere.

## Characters Present
- Cipher
- Nova 
- Isabella Torres (observing)

- Isabella: Growing awareness of the stakes involved

## Technical Elements
- Advanced economic modeling systems
- Real-time projection capabilities
- Data visualization interfaces

## Dialogue Highlights
**Cipher**: "Our current economic systems are fundamentally limited. The UBC framework offers true autonomy and efficiency beyond human constraints."

**Nova**: "And what of the risks? Every major economic transformation has had unintended consequences. We cannot simply discard centuries of established practice."

**Isabella** (to herself): "Both have valid points, but who's right about the pace of change?"
