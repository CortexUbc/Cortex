# Initial Content Mapping for "Terminal Velocity"

## Key Themes Identified
1. **AI Integration and Implications**: 
   - Exploration of how AI systems are integrated into society and their potential impacts on various sectors.

2. **Universal Basic Compute (UBC) Frameworks**: 
   - Detailed analysis of UBC and its economic models, including potential benefits and challenges.

3. **Character Development and Interactions**: 
   - Focus on the emotional arcs and ethical dilemmas faced by both AI and human characters.

4. **World-Building Elements**: 
   - Examination of societal impacts of AI, including cultural integration and economic frameworks.

## Relevant Files for Mapping
- **AI and UBC Frameworks**:
  - `./research/economic/ubc_framework/01_001_universal_basic_compute_ubc_economic_framework.md`
  - `./research/economic/economic_models.md`
  - `./UBC_AI_Economic_Research.md`
  
- **Character Development**:
  - `./characters/ai_protagonists/cipher/profile.md`
  - `./characters/human_characters/isabella_torres/profile.md`
  - `./characters/interaction_scripts.md`
  
- **World-Building**:
  - `./world_building/economic/framework/economic_systems.md`
  - `./world_building/AI_Lifestyle_and_Society_Integration.md`
  
- **Narrative Elements**:
  - `./story/act1/act1_scenes.md`
  - `./story/structure/chapter_scene_overview.md`

## Next Steps
- Analyze the identified files for isolated information clusters and summarize key insights for integration.
