## Project Objective
The goal of this project is to develop an intelligent system capable of managing communication and collaboration between different autonomous agents. The objective is to improve the efficiency, reliability, and scalability of these agents in accomplishing complex missions.

## Target Audience
The primary users of this system will be the autonomous agents themselves, as well as the human stakeholders responsible for overseeing and managing the missions.

## Key Features
1. **Agent Communication and Coordination**: The system must enable seamless communication and collaboration between the various autonomous agents, allowing them to coordinate their actions and share information effectively.

2. **Agent Specifications**:
   - **SpecificationsAgent**: Responsible for analyzing initial requests, defining technical requirements, and maintaining specification coherence throughout the project. Inputs include project requests and stakeholder feedback; outputs are detailed specifications and documentation.
   - **ProductionAgent**: Generates and optimizes code or text, implementing requests to achieve mission objectives. Expected to collaborate closely with the SpecificationsAgent to ensure alignment with project goals.
   - **ManagementAgent**: Coordinates activities, manages priorities, and tracks project progress. This agent will facilitate communication between all agents and ensure that timelines are met.
   - **EvaluationAgent**: Conducts tests, validates quality, and measures performance of the produced content. This agent will provide feedback to the ProductionAgent for continuous improvement.
   - **RedacteurAgent**: Updates textual content, ensuring style consistency and editorial quality. Works closely with the EvaluationAgent to incorporate feedback into revisions.
   - **DocumentalisteAgent**: Maintains coherence between content and documentation, analyzing and updating existing documentation as necessary.
   - **DuplicationAgent**: Detects and reduces duplication in content, identifying similar functions and proposing improvements.
   - **TesteurAgent**: Creates and maintains tests, executes test suites, and identifies potential issues in the system.

3. **Interaction Protocols**:
   - Agents will communicate through defined APIs, ensuring that data exchange is efficient and secure. Conflict resolution will be managed through a consensus mechanism, allowing agents to negotiate and reach agreements on shared objectives.

4. **Performance Metrics**:
   - Each agent's performance will be evaluated based on their ability to meet defined objectives, the quality of their outputs, and their contribution to the overall project success.
2. **Mission Management**: The system should provide tools and mechanisms for defining, tracking, and managing the progress of complex missions, including the ability to adjust objectives and priorities as needed.
3. **Performance Optimization**: The system must be able to continuously analyze and optimize the performance of the autonomous agents, identifying and addressing bottlenecks or inefficiencies.
4. **Scalability and Adaptability**: The system should be designed to scale up or down as the number of agents and missions changes, and be able to adapt to new requirements or technologies without major modifications.
5. **Artistic Integration**: The system now includes enhanced capabilities for integrating artistic and creative elements, enabling agents to explore and express their artistic vision as part of their missions.
5. **Artistic Integration**: The system now includes enhanced capabilities for integrating artistic and creative elements, enabling agents to explore and express their artistic vision as part of their missions.
5. **Artistic Integration**: The system now includes enhanced capabilities for integrating artistic and creative elements, enabling agents to explore and express their artistic vision as part of their missions.

## Success Criteria

1. **Performance**: The system must respond in less than 5 seconds.
2. **User Satisfaction**: The satisfaction rate must reach at least 90%.
3. **Compatibility**: The system must operate on the main platforms used by the organization.
