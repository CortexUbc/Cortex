# KinOS Project Overview

KinOS is an innovative framework of collaborative autonomous agents designed to carry out complex tasks such as writing documents or code. The system employs a unique approach where multiple specialized agents work in parallel, each with a distinct but interconnected role in the development process.

## Key Agent Roles and Responsibilities

Please refer to the [AGENTS.md](docs/AGENTS.md) file for detailed information on the various agents and their responsibilities within the KinOS system.

## Recent Changes

### Configuration Updates
- Added new environment variable `KIN_SECURITY_TOKEN` to enable secure communication between agents.
- Updated the `KIN_ECONOMIC_MODEL` variable to support the latest decentralized economic framework.

### New Features
- Introduced the SecurityAgent to handle authentication and access control for the KinOS system.
- Enhanced the GovernanceAgent to facilitate collective decision-making on economic policies and resource allocation.
- Improved the EconomicAgent's management of the decentralized economic framework, enabling more autonomous transactions between agents.
