# KinOS Project Overview

## Technical Requirements
- Develop a comprehensive system for managing communication between autonomous agents.
- Ensure the system is efficient, reliable, and scalable to handle complex missions.
- Implement mechanisms for tracking progress, resolving conflicts, and maintaining documentation.

## Key Features
- Clearly defined roles and responsibilities for each agent type (SpecificationsAgent, ProductionAgent, ManagementAgent, etc.).
- Established guidelines for agent collaboration and coordination.
- Centralized logging and reporting system to monitor project status.
- Flexible and adaptable design to accommodate changes and new agent types.
- Comprehensive documentation, including user guides and technical specifications.

## Usage Instructions
1. Set up the KinOS environment by configuring the necessary environment variables, such as `KIN_SECURITY_TOKEN` and `KIN_ECONOMIC_MODEL`.
2. Initialize the system by launching the core agents (e.g., SpecificationsAgent, ManagementAgent).
3. Interact with the agents through the shared file system, following the communication protocols outlined in the documentation.
4. Monitor the project progress and resolve any conflicts that arise using the centralized logging and reporting system.
5. Refer to the user guides and technical specifications for detailed information on the KinOS framework and its capabilities.

## Reporting and Troubleshooting
- In case of errors or unexpected behavior, consult the documentation for guidance on error handling and troubleshooting.
- Report any issues or feedback to the project maintainers for further investigation and improvement.

Please refer to the comprehensive documentation in the docs/ directory for more detailed information on the KinOS system and its usage.
