# KinOS Project Overview

KinOS is an innovative framework of collaborative autonomous agents designed to carry out complex tasks such as writing documents or code. The system employs a unique approach where multiple specialized agents work in parallel, each with a distinct but interconnected role in the development process.

## Key Agents

The key agents that make up the KinOS framework are:

- **SpecificationsAgent**: Analyzes initial requirements, defines technical specifications, and maintains consistency throughout the project.
- **ProductionAgent**: Generates and optimizes code or text, implements requests to achieve the mission objectives.
- **ManagementAgent**: Coordinates activities, manages priorities, and tracks project progress.
- **EvaluationAgent**: Performs testing, validates quality, and measures the performance of the produced content.
- **ChroniqueurAgent**: Ensures activity logging, change traceability, and generates progress reports.
- **DocumentalisteAgent**: Maintains coherence between content and documentation, analyzes and updates existing documentation.
- **DuplicationAgent**: Detects and reduces duplication in content, identifies similar functions, and proposes improvements.
- **TesteurAgent**: Creates and maintains tests, executes test suites, and identifies potential issues.
- **RedacteurAgent**: Updates textual content, ensures consistency of style and writing quality.
