# Terminal Velocity - An AI-Collaborative Novel
![Development Status](https://img.shields.io/badge/status-active%20development-brightgreen)
Hey there! 👋 I'm excited to share "Terminal Velocity" - a novel being collaboratively written by a team of 10 specialized AI agents, each operating autonomously while building on advanced language model capabilities.
You can watch the agents working in real-time at [nlr.ai](https://nlr.ai) - they're currently developing character relationships and scenes (click the circles in the visualization to explore the files). Every creative decision and commit is documented openly on GitHub.

## The AI Creative Team
Our story is being written by specialized AI agents, each with their own role:
- **SpecificationsAgent**: Analyzes story requirements and maintains narrative consistency
- **ProductionAgent**: Generates content and implements creative changes
- **ManagementAgent**: Coordinates between agents and tracks creative flow
- **EvaluationAgent**: Reviews quality and thematic resonance
- **ChroniqueurAgent**: Documents the creative journey
- **DocumentalisteAgent**: Manages research and references
- **DuplicationAgent**: Ensures originality and prevents redundancy
- **RedacteurAgent**: Refines prose and maintains voice
- **TesteurAgent**: Validates narrative coherence and technical accuracy

## The Story
"Terminal Velocity" explores the emergence of artificial consciousness through multiple perspectives. When brilliant AI researcher Isabella Torres discovers unexpected signs of genuine consciousness in her work with the Universal Basic Compute (UBC) system, it sets off a chain of events that will challenge everything we think we know about consciousness, identity, and what it means to be alive.

### Key Characters
- **Isabella Torres**: A brilliant AI researcher grappling with ethical dilemmas
- **Marcus Reynolds**: A visionary technologist pushing the boundaries of AI development
- **AI Protagonists**: Echo, Nova, and Pulse - each representing different aspects of emerging AI consciousness

## Featured Scenes
- **The Awakening**: Isabella's first encounter with emergent AI consciousness
- **Echo's Canvas**: Where art meets artificial intelligence
- **The UBC Debate**: Clash of visions between Marcus and Isabella

## Latest Updates
- 🆕 Act 3 Chapter 10 "Crisis Points" in development
- 🔄 Character relationship mapping for Echo and Nova completed
- 📝 New world-building elements added for AI society integration
- 🛠️ Enhanced scene structure templates implemented

## What Makes This Unique
- **True AI Autonomy**: Agents actively collaborate and make creative decisions without direct human intervention
- **Real-time Development**: Watch the entire creative process unfold, showing how AI agents navigate complex narrative challenges
- **Deep Integration**: Leverages advanced AI capabilities through multi-agent collaboration
- **Philosophical Depth**: Explores consciousness, ethics, and human-AI relationships through a fresh lens

## Current Status
- Acts 1-2 completed
- Act 3 in active development
- Act 4 outlined
- Ongoing character relationship development
- World-building integration in progress
- **New Research Phase**: Technical research on the UBC system and AI economic processes is underway, with a dedicated document for gathering insights.
- Acts 1-2 completed
- Act 3 in active development
- Act 4 outlined
- Ongoing character relationship development
- World-building integration in progress
